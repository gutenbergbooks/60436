<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4">BY A LONDON BANKER</p>


<p>I confess that when a publisher asked me to write
an introduction to Mr. Warren’s little book I
experienced some surprise; because, in the past, he
handled bankers rather roughly. Perhaps the
audacity of the request appealed to me. At any
rate, I consented to read the proof-sheets, and,
finally, perhaps a trifle reluctantly, to stand sponsor
for the work in a qualified sense. I do not agree
with all he says, by any means.</p>

<p>Here is the eighth edition of a well-written, interesting
guide for the customer, who has obviously
found it useful. The book would not have obtained
a market unless it were wanted. This must be
granted. And I think that it was wanted even from
the point of view of a banker.</p>

<p>The author in a short chapter tells us how and
why the joint-stock bank came to dwell among us.
Then he plunges into his subject—the Guide for the
Customer. The chapter on the cheque and its
various crossings is admirable. I only wish that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
clients of my own bank would read every word of
it, and save the time of our cashiers.</p>

<p>He who keeps his account in credit is told much
that he ought to know; the depositor is shown how
to check his interest; the borrower how to negotiate
a loan or advance; and everybody is told the manner
in which he may easily check the charges debited
in his pass-book. Speaking for my own bank, I do
not care who makes use of this clearly-put information.
Let our clients obtain the book by all means.
We shall then be spared the trouble of answering a
host of stupid questions during the busiest parts of
the year.</p>

<p>Touching upon “unclaimed balances,” I am of
the opinion that the public can be very well trusted
to look after its own interests; and after glancing
through my own ledgers I think that these unclaimed
sums would not amount, in the aggregate, to a really
large figure. Most of these dormant balances are
insignificant.</p>

<p>As to the pay of bank-men, I do not feel justified
in expressing an opinion, beyond asserting that the
wants of a bank-clerk are small. My advice to the
customer is—“read the book.”</p>

<small><small>BANKING EVOLUTION</small></small></h2>
</div>


<p>We owe a great deal to the financial instinct of the
Jew, who, having no country of his own, has developed
an acquisitive mania for the goods of those
people among whom he dwells, thanks to a progressive
civilization of which he was the pioneer, in comparative
safety; and, by an irony of fate, we are also
indebted to him for a religion, which his more subtle
mind rejects; yet, stranger still, it is a civilization
based on commerce that keeps the whole world
moderately sane, and tends to at least hold in check
the latent savagery of the blind enthusiast who
would still, but for her intervention, indulge in a
bloody crusade against all who hold opposite
opinions. A true civilization spells toleration; and
though a creditor can scarcely hope to be popular
with his debtors, he is at least entitled to the protection
of the law of the land in which he lives.</p>

<p>The Jews, who are supposed to have come over to
England about the time of the Conquest, gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
possessed themselves of the greater part of the coin
of the country; and the early English kings constantly
resorted to them for loans. As it was thought
unchristian to charge usury or interest, the business
of a money-lender was consequently held in abhorrence,
with the result that the Jews monopolized the
trade, and acquired immense fortunes by their dealings.
Their wealth naturally excited the intense
cupidity of their Christian neighbours, who, making
a pretext of their so-called abominations, raided from
time to time the Jewish quarters of the various
towns, in the hopes of annexing the fabulous treasure
in Jewry.</p>

<p>Under the ban of the Church, and detested by the
people, the popular feeling against the usurers became
so embittered that Edward I, under whose protection
they lived, after having in vain attempted to
persuade the Jews to accept Christianity, was compelled
to banish them from England; and from 1290
to the time of the Commonwealth (a period of about
360 years) the prohibition remained in force. But
the money-lender is a necessary evil; and after the
departure of the Jews certain Italian merchants,
known as Lombards, who had previously settled in
England, immediately filled their place; and Lombard
Street became as notorious for usury as had
been the Jewry.</p>

<p>The Jew may be described as a money-lender, and
the Lombard as a merchant-banker, though neither
was a banker as the word is now understood. Both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
however, lent money at high rates of interest. A
banker, in the English sense of the word, is a middleman
who borrows from one set of persons at a rate in
order to lend to another set at a greater rate, the
difference between the two rates being his margin of
profit; and banking in this sense was not practised in
England until quite the end of the first Charles’s
reign, when certain goldsmiths, who were originally
dealers in plate and in bullion, became private
bankers. The first run upon them was made in 1667,
when a Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway; and,
later, in 1672 Charles II closed the Exchequer,
refusing to pay the bankers either their principal or
interest, with the result that failures were numerous.</p>

<p>We are now approaching a new banking era; and
in 1694 the Bank of England, which was the first
joint-stock bank established in the three kingdoms,
was incorporated. The private bankers, instantly
recognizing in her a formidable rival, were actively
hostile; but all to no purpose; and in a very little
while they grouped themselves round the Old Lady,
who reduced their rates and kept them in order.
Hoares and Childs were in being before the Bank;
but the goldsmiths, long before the new movement
was a brilliant success, had few direct descendants in
London; and the majority of those private bankers
who opposed the Act of 1833 belonged to another
generation. At its inception the Bank did not enjoy
a monopoly; but upon the renewal of its charter in
1708 it was granted the monopoly of joint-stock bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>ing
in England, while the partners in a private bank
could not exceed six in number. This number was
increased to ten in 1857.</p>

<p>Country banking developed slowly in England;
and it was not until towards the close of the eighteenth
century that private firms began to multiply
in the provinces; but the Bank of England’s iniquitous
monopoly kept them small and weak, and between
1792 and 1820 over one thousand private
bankers came to grief, while the crisis of 1825 further
thinned their ranks and almost emptied the vaults
of the Bank of England, when it dawned upon the
Government that the state of the money-market
was distinctly rotten, and that it would remain so
until the Bank’s monopoly disappeared. The result
was the usual committee and the usual compromise.</p>

<p>The Act of 1826 allowed joint-stock banks of unlimited
liability to be formed in England and to carry
on business at a greater distance than sixty-five miles
from London; but such institutions could not open
an office in London. Neither could they issue notes
at a place within sixty-five miles thereof, nor draw
any bills on London for a less amount than £50. In
1833, however, they were allowed to make their bills
and notes for less than £50 payable on demand at
their London agents. The demand for these establishments
was not at first considerable; and very few
were formed until after five or six years of the passing
of this Act; but in 1830 the railway movement began
in earnest, and from 1833 to 1836 joint-stock banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
were established throughout the country in considerable
numbers. This sudden boom in banking companies
could only have one result; and failures
became so numerous that Sir Robert Peel, in 1844,
passed his Joint-Stock Banking Act, which, being
found worse than the disease itself, was repealed in
1857.</p>

<p>London, we have seen, contained only one banking
corporation and numerous private bankers, who,
forming a monopoly, were practically rich men’s
banks; for they would only accept an account provided
the balance was not reduced below a certain sum,
while from 1813 to 1833 some twenty of them suspended
payment; so stability was not one of their
distinguishing characteristics. It soon became apparent
that the Bank of England and the private
bankers were quite unable to minister to the growing
trade of the capital; and in 1833 joint-stock banks
were allowed to be formed in London, but upon the
distinct understanding that they were to be banks of
deposit and not banks of issue. In other words, they
could not issue their own notes, so were compelled to
use those of the Bank of England. The first London
joint-stock bank was the London and Westminster,
whose prospectus was issued in 1833; but the shares
were subscribed slowly, and the bank did not open its
doors to the public until the March of the year
following. Then came the London Joint-Stock Bank
in 1836, and the Union Bank in 1839.</p>

<p>It is usual, in this little island, to hark back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
good old days, and then, with a sigh, to regret that
the old order of things no longer exists; yet it must be
confessed that the London private bankers were of
no service whatsoever to the small man of business,
whom they simply ignored. The joint-stock banks
however, ministered to the wants of the small trader;
and, by diving into the heart of the masses, proved
that a large number of small balances are even more
desirable than a small number of large accounts,
whilst in the end they practically drove the private
banker, handicapped as he was by the law of the
land, out of the market, or, at least, reduced him to
impotency. But the London joint-stock banks, in
those early days, were not without their grievances;
and both the private bankers and the Bank of England
seized upon every pretext in order to harass
them. Being merely common law partnerships, they
did not come under the 1826 Act; and until the Act
of 1844 they were not relieved from certain restrictions
which need not be discussed here.</p>

<p>But the year of banking reform was, of course, 1844,
when, fortunately for the trade of the country, the
Bank of England was stripped of all its privileges
except that relating to the issuing of notes. The
Bank Charter Act of 1844 gave the Bank of England
the monopoly of issuing notes in London and within
sixty-five miles of it. No new bank of issue was to
be formed, while a provincial bank, upon opening in
London, forfeited its issue. The cheque, however,
soon became more powerful than the note; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
larger provincial banking companies gladly made the
sacrifice in order to establish themselves in the
capital. The next step forward was when the joint-stock
banks broke up the cabal of private bankers
and were admitted to the Clearing House in 1854;
though it is a little remarkable that, having posed as
martyrs and vigorously denounced their oppressors,
they should now take upon themselves to exclude
certain companies which have as good a right as they
to enter the sacred portals of the House; but the
mote in one’s neighbour’s eye is always so much more
apparent than the beam in one’s own.</p>

<p>By the Act of 1858 a joint-stock bank was allowed
to limit the liability of its shareholders; but the Act,
was not made compulsory; and though all the companies
formed subsequently registered under this Act
the members of those in existence prior thereto were
liable for the debts of the company in which they held
shares to their last shilling. Then came the failures
of the West of England Bank and the City of Glasgow
Bank in 1878; and shareholders in banks of unlimited
liability, with the fate of the members of these
two institutions before their eyes, began to weigh
their responsibilities, with the result that many sold
out at panic prices in haste and regretted at leisure.
The more prudent, though they held their shares,
began an agitation for reform, which gave birth to
the Act of 1879. We need not discuss this Act;
though it may just be said that every joint-stock
bank in the three kingdoms which is not limited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
its charter is now a bank of limited liability under the
Companies Acts.</p>

<p>At this juncture, perhaps, a few words may be said
with reference to the Bank of England, which, with a
contempt for evidence that is truly British, the public
is convinced cannot suspend payment; yet the
Bank’s career has been decidedly checkered; and
even after the passing of the Act of 1844 the Old
Lady was only saved by the intervention of the
Government in 1847, 1857 and 1866, while during
the Baring crisis of 1890 she was compelled to borrow
from the Bank of France; so, evidently, her system
is not by any means a perfect one; but one does not
expect perfection in finance. The perfect financial
machine and the perfect man are alike impossibilities.
As to the latter, did he exist, he would seem positively
inhuman.</p>

<p>It need not be said that this sketch of the English
banking movement is necessarily imperfect, if only
because of the small space into which it is condensed;
but the average reader certainly would not trouble to
digest two hundred pages on the subject of banking
evolution; so possibly it may prove acceptable in
this form.</p>

<p>We have seen that the London private banker was
a rich man’s banker; but it was otherwise with the
country private banker, who was often of great assistance
to the small trader, at whom the joint-stock
banks will not now look unless he approaches them
with his pockets stuffed with securities when anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to overdraw his account. The maxim of the companies
is: “Let the customers take all risks.” And
if this rule is broken, then the case is an exceptional
one. We need not discuss here whether or not this
policy be essential to modern banking; but it is
quite evident that the small man of business has lost
a good friend in the old-fashioned country banker,
whose place has not been taken by that person of
peculiar views and training—the bank-manager or
clerk-in-charge, whose urbanity must be more than
painful to those would-be borrowers without security
who ask for bread and are politely offered—a
stone.</p>

<p>What we have to discover is why the country
banker has been practically forced out of the market
by the joint-stock system; and the reason is not difficult
to explain. In the first place we know that,
since 1857, the partners in a private bank have been
limited to ten; consequently, however anxious a
banker may have been to extend his system of
branches and develop his business, the difficulty of
insufficient capital presented itself; whereas his
rivals, who can appeal to thousands of small investors,
could, once having established their credit,
easily obtain as much capital as they required. The
private banker, therefore, ministered to the wants
of a certain town, district, or county; but the joint-stock
banks spread their tentacles throughout the
length and breadth of England; and, like an octopus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
eventually strangled him in a manner which will be
explained.</p>

<p>In London and throughout the provinces there
were numerous small firms of private bankers—small,
that is to say, when contrasted with their joint-stock
competitors. The banks in a manufacturing district
or in a busy city would, especially during periods of
active trade and rising prices, be called upon to
advance large sums to their customers; but if a
banker collected his deposits from a few branches
within the district whence the demand arose, he
would soon find himself unable to meet the requirements
of his customers. But the joint-stock banks,
which have branches in many counties, can pour
their deposits into those centres where demand is
active; and it is obvious that a small private banker
cannot hope to compete successfully against the
superior organization of the companies. With the
private banker it soon became a question of restricting
advances; and his customers, finding that they
could not obtain all the accommodation they required,
naturally applied to his rivals, who, if tangible
securities were forthcoming, met their demands with
ease.</p>

<p>The London and provincial banking companies,
which farm both the agricultural and the manufacturing
districts, by pouring their surplus capital into
the London money-market, speedily obtained all the
best business; and those private bankers who did
not either amalgamate with, or adopt the system of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
their successful rivals found themselves hopelessly
out-distanced. Hence the triumph of joint-stock
banking and the advent of the director and his
humble, most obedient servant, the clerk-in-charge,
who “manages” a country branch, but whose power,
in reality, is of the smallest, all the applications for
advances above a certain sum having to be submitted
to the chief office, while he himself is powerless to act
until he receives his instructions from headquarters.</p>

<p>This form of competition would be felt less in
an agricultural county where the deposits a banker
collects are greatly in excess of the demand made
upon him for advances; but even there the private
banker’s luck has deserted him; for the agricultural
depression thinned the ranks of his best customers,
and, of course, left him a legacy of bad debts. We
should, therefore, expect to see the private bankers
disappear from the great towns first, and, finally,
from the agricultural centres. The law of the land
has kept them small; and the tentacles of the joint-stock
companies have almost exterminated a class of
men who enjoyed the friendship and confidence of
their clients to an extent that a clerk-in-charge upon
a salary of from £200 to £500 a year can never even
approach.</p>

<p>Though we live in an age of great machines, which,
for reasons that will be explained later, can declare
huge dividends, every now and again we hear of
the inception of a new banking company. The new
arrival, perhaps, waxes more than eloquent upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
large dividends paid by the existing companies, and
then dwells enthusiastically upon the immense profits
it hopes to earn; but can a small company ever
establish its credit in face of the network of branches
which now cover the land? The person who applies
for its shares must certainly be of a most sanguine
disposition.</p>

<p>It is the powers that be that always excite the
keenest interest, doubtless because of the possibility
that a knowledge of their habits and ways may prove
of pecuniary benefit to the student; and this object
has been kept well in view throughout the following
chapters.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II <br/>
<small><small>ON THE CHOICE OF A BANKER</small></small></h2>
</div>

<p>There is an opinion which is very prevalent to the
effect that, provided one’s account be an overdrawn
one, it does not matter where it is kept; and, of
course, if it were possible to find a nice, philanthropic
banker who would allow one a big overdraft without
even hinting at security, there would be much truth
in the assertion; but in view of the existing relations
between banker and client, the idea is both unfortunate
and fallacious. We have seen how the large
joint-stock banks, by developing their system of
branches, literally smothered the private banker;
and the smaller companies, which possess but few
branches, are now being forced to amalgamate with
the larger for the same reason. If, therefore, a man
has a large advance from a small provincial banking
company, it may occur that, just when he is anxious
to discount more bills or to increase his overdraft, the
bank will be unable to accommodate him; and it
therefore follows that a large bank, whose resources
are abundant, is as essential to the really great
borrower as it is safer for the depositor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>A person whose account is in credit or who leaves
money with a banker at interest naturally attaches
the greater importance to the safety of his balance or
principal; and, secondly, he endeavours to obtain as
high a rate as possible; but he would not be so
foolish as to sacrifice security to a high rate of interest;
though, where the banks are equally well managed,
he would select the one that offered him the
higher rate or the cheaper facilities. Conversely, the
person whose account is overdrawn would, other
things being equal, choose the bank that offered to
work his account the cheapest.</p>

<p>Now, a banker’s liabilities to the public are due on
demand, and at short notice; and they would consist
principally of “deposit and current accounts, and
notes and drafts in circulation.” These, of course,
will be found on the left-hand side of the balance-sheet.
As the banker’s deposits may be demanded
from him at any unlucky moment, it follows that he is
compelled to hold a certain sum of cash (legal tender)
in reserve; and the larger that sum, the safer are the
customers’ balances. A person, therefore, who is
looking for a safe banker, should see that the firm or
company which he selects possesses at least from £12
to £18 in coin, bank-notes and cash with the Bank of
England against each £100 it owes to the public. He
will find the public liabilities on the left-hand side of
the balance-sheet and the cash in hand on the right;
and a proportion sum will soon give him his answer.</p>

<p>But a really strong, well-managed bank only ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>vances
to, and discounts bills of exchange for, its
customers to such an extent as will enable it to hold
from £45 to £50 in cash, money at call and investments
to every £100 of its public indebtedness. Cash,
of course, is its vital asset; and after cash comes
Consols and other British Government securities in
which, except at the very height of a panic, there is
always a market. These are a bank’s so-called
liquid assets; and it may just be added that when
a bank mixes its cash and money at call and notice
together, and an accommodating auditor declares
that such a medley “exhibits a true and correct
view of the state of the company’s affairs,” the bank
is probably so weak in actual cash as to deem it
wise not to publish the figures.</p>

<p>Money at call and short notice would represent
advances to the bill-brokers and to the Stock Exchange;
and though such loans could doubtless be
easily called in during normal times, they would be
difficult to collect when the money-market was in a
turmoil. A greater part of the advances made to the
Stock Exchange, though classed as liquid assets, are
in reality loans in disguise; for if the banks were to
suddenly ask the stockbrokers to redeem their pledged
stocks and shares, those gentlemen would be hammered
in clusters; and the shares, when flung upon
the market to be sold at what they would fetch,
would rapidly depreciate. It would certainly be
interesting were the banks to specify the amount of
their so-called short loans to the Stock Exchange;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and, with a lively recollection of 1890, it is to be
hoped that they are kept within bounds, as, upon
that occasion, this class of advance hung like a mill-stone
round their necks. Such liquid assets, it is to
be feared, are more likely to sink the good ship than
to save her in a storm.</p>

<p>Having ascertained the ratio per cent. of a bank’s
cash in hand to its public liabilities, and glanced at
the call-money, the list of investments should be
carefully criticized. When a banking company describes
its list thus: “Consols and other securities,”
it may be taken for granted that its holding of Consols
is a small one. This description, in fact, is taken from
the balance-sheet of an English provincial banking
company, which holds about £19 in cash, call-money
and securities to each £100 it owes to its customers;
and yet it can find people who are foolish enough to
do business with it. Considered as a financial institution,
it is practically bankrupt; yet its deposits
amount to over £4,000,000. Fortunately, however,
this institution is one of the few exceptions which are
best avoided. Another very weak joint-stock bank
describes its investments as consisting of “English
Government and railway stocks.” Its cash and call-money
are consolidated into one total; but, more remarkable
still, an auditor actually has the impudence
to declare that the balance-sheet “exhibits a true
and correct view of the company’s affairs,” when, of
course, it is not worth the paper upon which it is
printed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>A well-managed bank, as a rule, states its holding
of Consols distinctly, and, sometimes, the figures at
which they have been taken. If it do not, then the
value of its British Government securities is given
separately. Next, it usually specifies its India Government
Stock, and so on; and, finally, “other
securities,” which, assumably, are of a non-liquid
nature, are given last because they are of the least
value from a banker’s point of view. Naturally, if a
bank possess a gilt-edged list, it advertises the fact in
its balance-sheet; and those companies which indulge
in ambiguity are, in nine cases out of ten, the banks
to avoid. For instance, you will not find any evasions
of this nature in the balance-sheets of such
powerful companies as the London and County
Bank, the Union and Smiths, the London City and
Midland, and other really first-rate institutions, for
the simple reason that there is no occasion for them.
As a rule, the clearer the balance-sheet, the stronger
is the bank; and the sinners, consequently, are the
smaller banks, which, situated in a manufacturing
centre, are unable to collect sufficient working
resources to finance their customers. Their ultimate
fate, it need not be said, is amalgamation with a
more powerful rival.</p>

<p>When choosing a banker, therefore, one should first
ascertain that he has an abundant reserve of cash in
hand, and, secondly, that his so-called liquid assets
(his cash, call-money and securities) amount to from
£45 to £50 against each £100 to which he is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>debted
to the public. And as to those private
bankers who do not issue a balance-sheet, they are,
in the first place, guilty of the sin of omission; and,
in these days, when faith is not the predominant note,
there seems but little inducement to buy a pig in a
poke when a large banker’s balance-sheet may be had
for the asking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III <br/>
<small><small>THE CHEQUE AND ITS VARIOUS CROSSINGS</small></small></h2>
</div>

<p>A cheque is often described as a bill of exchange,
drawn by a customer on his banker, for a sum certain
in money, payable on demand. In these days, when
the mere babe produces his cheque-book on the
slightest provocation, it seems unnecessary to describe
how a cheque should be drawn; though it may
just be added that it must bear a stamp of one penny,
and that the stamp may be either impressed or
adhesive. A customer, therefore, can draw a cheque
on his banker upon a sheet of notepaper; but he
would be well advised, except under exceptional
circumstances, to use the forms supplied to him.</p>


<h3>Order or Bearer.</h3>

<p>A cheque is payable either to “order” or to
“bearer”; and, if the latter word be used, then it
does not require indorsing, while should neither word
be upon the document, the cheque is held to be an
“order” one. Either the person to whom it is payable
or the drawer may change a cheque from bearer
to order; and this he would do by running his pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
through the former word; but the drawer alone can
alter an order cheque by writing the word “bearer”
in full and initialling the alteration. If the cheque be
signed by more than one drawer, then all should add
their initials to any correction it may be desirable to
make.</p>


<h3>Date of a Cheque.</h3>

<p>Any person who receives an undated cheque is
entitled to fill in what he believes to be the correct
date, and need not trouble to return it to the drawer
for that purpose. He cannot, of course, make any
<i>alteration</i> in the date, but should, in the event of a
mistake on the drawer’s part, return it to him for
correction, when he (the drawer) would make the
desired alteration and write his initials against it. It
is, perhaps, as well to remember that a certain class
of debtors, who may be described as either “hard
up” or “shady,” have their little peculiarities; and
one of them is to post-date their cheques when they
know that there is not sufficient money at the bank
to meet them. Their object, of course, is to gain
time; and should a payee, upon receiving such a
cheque, have cause to think that he is dealing with
one of these gentlemen, he might pay in the cheque
to his own banker for collection, and write pretty
plainly to the drawer, requesting him to call at his
banker’s and put the cheque in order. Though a
cheque be either post-dated, that is to say, dated so
that it falls due after the day upon which it is drawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
or dated on a Sunday, the document is not invalidated
thereby.</p>


<h3>A Stale or Out-of-Date Cheque.</h3>

<p>Most bankers would probably decline to pay a
cheque which had been outstanding more than six
months. The drawer, however, does not cease to be
liable upon the instrument until six years after the
date thereupon; though he may claim damages
against the payee if he can prove that he has suffered
loss through his delay.</p>


<h3>Crossed Cheques.</h3>

<p>Though this practice originated in the United
Kingdom, the French banks have now adopted the
idea, which is as simple as it is undoubtedly useful
and protective to the customer. A cheque may be
crossed either generally or specially—specially, that
is to say, to some bank or to the account of an individual
who keeps an account with a banker.</p>

<p>If a customer draw two parallel lines across the
face of a cheque, thus, /&nbsp;/, he has instructed his banker
<i>not</i> to give cash in exchange for it to the payee across
his counter. It follows that a cheque so marked must
be passed through a banking account. The words
“&amp; Co.” are sometimes written between the lines;
but this addition is almost meaningless, the simple
crossing being all that is required.</p>

<p>A person who draws two parallel lines across his
cheque, gives the following instructions to his banker:
“Do not pay cash over your counter in exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for this cheque, which must reach you through a
banker, and be paid to him alone.”</p>

<p>When, therefore, you wish a person to whom your
cheque is made payable to go to your banker’s and
draw the money, you will be careful not to cross it.
Practice, somehow, always seems at war with theory,
and it is not by any means an unusual occurrence for
a lady, after having deliberately told her banker not
to pay cash for her cheque to the presenter, to indignantly
inquire why he did not disobey her behest
and do so. A prudent teller seldom descends to
either argument or explanation, but calmly accepts
such reproof as one of the amenities of his calling, and
resigns himself philosophically to the inevitable.</p>


<h3>Not Negotiable Cheques.</h3>

<p>This description is somewhat misleading, for a
cheque crossed /<small>not&nbsp;negotiable</small>/ is in reality negotiable,
though not so fully as is the one that has been discussed
in the foregoing division. The distinction,
however, is not difficult to grasp. Take a cheque with
two parallel lines across the face simply. Now, if such
a document be lost, and find its way into dishonest
hands, a third party, who gives value in exchange for
it, provided he have no guilty knowledge, has a good
title against all the world, and can compel the drawer
to pay him the sum for which it is made out.</p>

<p>For instance, A draws a cheque for £20 payable to
B, and crosses it /<small>&amp;&nbsp;Co</small>/. B, the payee, after having
written his name on the back of the cheque, loses it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
C picks it up and passes it on to D, who gives him cash
or goods in exchange for it. As B has indorsed the
cheque he will have to bear the loss, even though he
has got A, the drawer, to stop payment of it at his
banker’s.</p>

<p>But had the words “not negotiable” been added,
D could not have enforced his claim, although he was
a <i>bonâ-fide</i> holder for value. A “not negotiable”
cheque warns any holder for value thus:—</p>

<p>“You must, if you part with either cash or goods
in exchange for this document, be prepared to take
all risks upon your own shoulders. The crossing
hereon gives you due notice that you must act upon
your own responsibility, and the law, therefore,
affords you no protection.”</p>

<p>A business man cannot be too careful in dealing
with a cheque thus marked; and unless he be well
acquainted with the holder, he should decline to part
with either cash or goods in exchange for it. One
should never, even if one know that the drawer is a
man of means, and that the signature upon the cheque
is genuine, give value for it to a stranger, as there is
always the danger of one’s having to make good the
loss of any prior holder, who may have been defrauded,
whilst if the payee cannot enforce his claim
against the drawer, then a holder for value cannot.</p>

<p>A “not negotiable” cheque, in short, is analogous
to an over-due bill. Any person who may deal with a
a bill after its maturity does so upon the understanding,
or, better, supposition, that he is acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
any flaw there may be in the title. He may not
know of any; but the law holds that he does. It is
precisely the same with a “not negotiable” cheque.</p>

<p>Cheques, which are crossed in the manner already
described, are said to be crossed generally.</p>


<h3>Cheques Crossed Specially.</h3>

<p>A cheque is said to be crossed specially when one
writes across the face of it, say:—</p>

<p>
<span class="pad4">“A/C John Smith,</span><br />
<span class="pad8">Provident Bank of London.”</span>
</p>

<p>One may name, in the crossing, any particular bank,
and the banker upon whom the cheque is drawn will
take care that it comes through the channel indicated
thereupon. In the above illustration, for instance,
your banker will see that the cheque has the name of
the “Provident Bank of London” stamped upon it;
and should he not find it there, then he would decline
to pay the document.</p>

<p>Either the payee or the holder of an uncrossed
cheque may cross it generally or specially; and if it
be already crossed generally, then either can cross it
specially, or add the words “not negotiable.”</p>


<h3>How to Cancel a Crossing.</h3>

<p>The drawer alone can do this by writing upon the
cheque the words “pay cash,” and signing his name
beneath them in full.</p>


<h3>How to Indorse or Back a Cheque.</h3>

<p>For all practical purposes one cannot do better than
sign one’s name upon the back of a cheque exactly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the drawer has written it upon the face, with, of
course, the omission of any courtesy title, such as
Miss, Mr. or Esquire, which are merely there as a
mark of civilization and progress. If one’s name be
spelt incorrectly, then one should back the cheque just
as it is drawn, and write one’s correct name underneath
the misspelt signature. Further, do not bully
the cashier if he make this request of you, for to do
so is the sign of a weak mind.</p>

<p>A cheque payable to John Smith, Esq., or to Mr.
John Smith, should be indorsed:—</p>

<p class="center">“John Smith.”</p>

<p>Doctor John Smith may sign “J. Smith, M.D.”;
and Colonel John Smith, “J. Smith, Colonel.”
These embellishments, however, are as unnecessary
as a flourish would be on the final <i>h</i> of Smith, and, in
a busy age, the sarcastic person, like the law, regards
them as superfluous. A Miss Mary Smith, who has
married a Mr. John Brown, would indorse a cheque
made payable to her in her maiden name:—</p>

<p class="center">“Mary Brown, <i>née</i> Smith.”</p>

<p>If the cheque be made out to Mrs. John Brown, then
she signs:—</p>

<p class="center">“Mary Brown, wife of John Brown,”</p>

<p>or</p>

<p class="center">“Mary Brown (Mrs. John Brown)” in brackets.</p>

<p>Certain ladies of a masterful temperament appear to
entertain a strong objection to signing themselves
“the wife of” such-and-such an individual, as
though the designation smacks of an inferiority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which they are not conscious; and such susceptibilities
may at least be soothed by placing the opprobrious
term within brackets.</p>

<p>A cheque payable to Mrs. Brown or bearer would
not, of course, require her name upon the back. But
if it were to order, then she would indorse it either M.
Brown or Mary Brown. When the drawer omits
one’s initials, one should write one’s usual signature
upon the back of the cheque; and though it is not
necessary to sign christian names in full, even when
they are so written upon the document, the capital
letters must, of course, agree with those upon the face.
A cheque drawn in favour of Messrs. Robinson is
obviously payable to two or more persons of that
name, so it may be indorsed: “A. &amp; C. Robinson,”
“Robinson &amp; Son,” “Robinson Brothers,” or
“Robinsons.” “Robinson and Nephew” would
not, however, meet the case, for it by no means
follows that the nephew is a Robinson. It is equally
as probable that he may be a Smith or a Jones—or a
somebody else. In practice, provided the cheque be
for a small amount, the paying banker is seldom
squeamish, but when a large sum is in question he
naturally takes care that he is upon the safe side, for
the good man is very human. Where a cheque is
payable to two or more persons, who are not partners,
then all should indorse.</p>

<p>A payee who is unable to write must make his
mark or cross (the trade-mark of the illiterate) in
the presence of a witness, who attests it thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="mw20">
<p class="center">
<small><small>his</small></small><br />
George&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown.<br />
<small><small>mark</small></small></p>

<p class="right">Witness:<br />
Robert White,<br />
55, High Street,<br />
Birmingham.</p>
</div>

<p>When the payee (the person to whom a cheque is payable)
writes his name upon the back of an “order”
cheque the document is said to be indorsed in blank,
and becomes in effect payable to bearer. He can,
however, make it payable to another person by writing
above his signature: “Pay Thomas Brown or
order.” Thomas Brown must then indorse the
cheque. Further, any holder may write this request
above the indorser’s signature, thereby converting an
indorsement in blank into a special indorsement.</p>

<p>A restrictive indorsement gives the indorsee no
power to transfer his rights. Hence a cheque indorsed
to “John Smith only” prevents further
negotiation of the instrument. Where a cheque is
payable to, say, John Smith for R. Jones, the payee
simply has to write his own name on the back.</p>

<p>Should the name of a fictitious or non-existing
person be inserted as payee in an order cheque, the
document may be treated as payable to bearer.
Cheques drawn to “cash,” “house,” etc., are so
treated. It is usual, however, for the drawer to indorse
them, just as he would a cheque payable to
“self or order.”</p>

<p>Any executor or administrator can indorse a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cheque made payable to a deceased person, but all
trustees must sign. In practice, a banker usually
guarantees or confirms these indorsements.</p>

<p>Finally it may be added that it is not illegal to
indorse a cheque in pencil, though a banker would
probably decline to honour it on the plea that it
becomes fainter as time progresses. Again, too, an
indorsement may be made on the face as well as upon
the back of a cheque, but the customer, unless he be
of a peculiarly combative temperament, merely
wishes to know what is usual, and we are all aware of
the accepted rule in this instance.</p>


<h3>Agents and “Per Pro” Indorsements.</h3>

<p>A signature by procuration indicates that the
agent’s power to bind his principal may be, and
probably is, limited. For instance, the agent may
only have authority to indorse cheques and bills, and
if he sign as either drawer or acceptor, he cannot bind
his principal. Moreover, as a procuration signature
operates as notice of his limitations, a holder has no
claim upon his principal, as he should have protected
himself by demanding to see the agent’s letter of
authority.</p>

<p>A customer, when he wishes another person to
draw cheques on his behalf, gives a letter of authority
to his banker, and states therein exactly what his
nominee or agent may do. The authority may only
allow a certain person to sign cheques on his behalf
up to, say, £100, and the banker would, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
refuse any cheque drawn in excess of that sum.
Most bankers keep printed forms of this description,
and the customer, if he obtain one, can, by crossing
out what the agent may <i>not</i> do, limit his power to
any extent he thinks necessary. These letters need
not be stamped, and, unless previously revoked,
they continue in force until the bankruptcy, insanity,
or death of the principal.</p>

<p>We can now see that dealing with an agent is not
unattended by certain risks. The banker always
protects himself by ascertaining that an agent really
has authority when he signs the name of a client in
the capacity of either drawer or indorser, but as he
(the <i>paying</i> banker) is not liable upon either a forged
or an unauthorized indorsement, <i>per pro</i> indorsements
are universally accepted by the banks in the
ordinary course of business. They are not, however,
legally obliged to pass them, and a banker may
demand to see an agent’s authority or insist upon
having a confirmation of the indorsement.</p>

<p>An agent usually signs:—</p>

<p class="center">
“<i>per pro</i> (or <i>p.p.</i>) John Brown,<br />
Robert Smith.”<br />
</p>

<p>It has been held that “<i>p.p.</i> Mr. John Brown, Robert
Smith,” is a good discharge, but the foregoing method
is the more general. There have also been decisions
in favour of the prefixes “pro” and “for,” though
most bankers refuse to pay cheques so indorsed.
Procuration indorsements are not accepted on
dividend-warrants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>A cheque payable to Brown’s Drapery Stores may
be indorsed:—</p>

<div class="mw20">
<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">“<i>p.p.</i> Brown’s Drapery Stores,</span><br />
<span class="pad8">Thomas Brown, Proprietor.”</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Again, should Thomas Brown receive a cheque,
which, he knows, is intended for him, though made
payable to Thomas Bright, he might sign upon the
back: “<i>p.p.</i> T. Bright, Thomas Brown.” He can
explain the reason for this to his own banker, but the
paying banker will not question the indorsement.
Cheques which are drawn in favour of an establishment
one owns, or of a commodity one sells, can
always be backed “<i>per pro</i>.”</p>

<p>A cheque to the order of a limited or unlimited
company is generally indorsed <i>per pro</i> the company,
and the signer should then state the position he occupies,
whether director, secretary, manager or cashier,
as in the following illustration:—</p>

<div class="mw20">
<p class="right">
“<i>p.p.</i> The Hull Shipping Company, Limited,<br />
<span class="padr6">Walter Wilson,</span><br />
Manager.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It is always advisable to sign for or on behalf of a
company, and to state in what capacity one signs, so
as to avoid a personal liability.</p>

<p>An agent who signs under a power of attorney,
usually indorses: “Thomas Brown by his attorney
William Smith.” It is as well to remember that a
power of attorney often confines the agent’s power,
as in the case of a letter of authority, within very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
narrow limits, and that the principal is only bound
by its provisions.</p>


<h3>Banker’s Liability on Forged Indorsements.</h3>

<p>The paying banker is not liable upon a forged or
unauthorized indorsement, but the collecting banker
is in the case of uncrossed cheques, and, according to
a recent decision by the House of Lords, may be upon
crossed ones. If a banker credit his customer’s account
with the amount of a crossed cheque <i>after</i> it has
been cleared, he is protected by Section 82 of the
Bills of Exchange Act; but should he credit his
client’s account with the said cheque before he himself
has collected it, then he ceases to be a mere agent,
and becomes a holder for value, and, consequently,
liable upon a forged indorsement. As it is usual,
both in London and the provinces, to credit a customer’s
account with cheques on the day that he
pays them in, it follows that an employer, if his
agent have indorsed crossed cheques without authority
and placed them to an account in his own name,
can recover their amount from his agent’s banker.</p>


<h3>Banker’s Liability where Drawer’s Signature is
Forged.</h3>

<p>The banker is liable to a customer upon any forged
cheque he debits to his account.</p>


<h3>When a Cheque is Legally Paid.</h3>

<p>A banker, having passed the cash across his counter,
cannot legally demand it back again, and the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>senter
may please himself whether or not, if asked, he
will return the money. The banker has no power to
compel him.</p>


<h3>Stopping Payment of a Cheque or Bill.</h3>

<p>This must be done by the drawer or acceptor, as
the case may be, and by him alone. He should write
a note to his banker, giving an exact copy of the
cheque or bill he wishes returned, and the banker
will then mark his ledger and instruct the cashiers to
refuse payment of the document, if presented. Should
he pay the instrument in spite of the customer’s order
to the contrary, he will have to make good any loss
occasioned by his negligence.</p>


<h3>Lost Cheques.</h3>

<p>The payee or the holder who loses a cheque can,
of course, give notice of his loss to the banker upon
whom it is drawn, and the banker would doubtless
question any presenter, but he, the payee or holder,
must obtain an order from the drawer instructing
his banker to stop payment. The drawer, though he
cannot refuse such a request, may insist upon receiving
security before he issues a fresh cheque. Further,
if the drawer employ the customary means of communication,
such as, for instance, sending his cheque
through the post, or should the payee himself select a
particular channel, then any loss falls upon the latter.
A holder for value, however, provided the cheque be
not tainted with forgery, and that it be not crossed
“not negotiable,” can compel payment from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
drawer, who must then fall back upon his indemnity
should he have issued a duplicate cheque.</p>


<h3>Sending Cheques through the Post.</h3>

<p>When remitting cheques to one’s banker for the
credit of one’s account it is advisable to write across
the face of each: “A/C Payee, with —— Bank of
London.” In the event of a cheque thus marked
getting into dishonest hands no banker would care
to collect it. Where the sender is the holder, and
not the payee, he would, of course, cross the cheque
“A/C John Jones,” etc.</p>

<p>As the paying banker is not liable on a forged
indorsement, it is always desirable to receive an
acknowledgment from the payee of a cheque posted
to him. Should not this come to hand in proper
time, then payment of the cheque might be stopped
at the bank, and the stop removed when the receipt
arrives. It is, perhaps, as well to remember, when
sending a crossed cheque through the post, that the
addition of the words “not negotiable” lessens the
risk of both payee and drawer.</p>


<h3>Paid Cheques.</h3>

<p>These are the legal property of the drawer; but a
banker is entitled to an acknowledgment from the
customer before he surrenders them.</p>


<h3>Providing for Cheques Specially.</h3>

<p>A customer, whether his account be overdrawn or
not, may pay in a certain sum to his credit, and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>quest
his banker to pay a particular cheque against it.
The person who adopts this procedure is invariably
somewhat “hard up”; and having issued cheques
which, in the aggregate, amount to more than the
balance at his credit, or which would, if presented,
overdraw his account beyond the agreed sum, he is
naturally nervous lest his banker should return one or
two of them. Assuming that he has some half-dozen
cheques in circulation, but is particularly anxious to
pay one to John Smith, who has threatened to
sell him up, for £30, and another for £40 to William
James for rent, then he should pay £70 to his credit,
and write across his paying-in slip: “To provide for
my cheques of £30 to John Smith and £40 to W.
James specially.” The banker, if he accept the slip,
is bound to hold the money against the cheques in
question.</p>


<h3>Present your Cheques at Once.</h3>

<p>A business man, in order to give himself every
chance, will pay all cheques to the credit of his banking
account upon the day he receives them from his
customers. He has, in the legal sense, until the close
of the first business-day following the day he gets the
cheque, when, if he like, he can post it to his agent,
who has the same time-allowance for presentment,
provided the cheque be not drawn upon a bank in
his own town. If he delay longer any loss incurred
by the drawer through non-presentation will fall
upon the payee’s shoulders. For instance, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the bank fail, the payee might be saddled with a
bad debt through his delay.</p>

<p>A customer who has a doubtful cheque in his possession,
and who is anxious to know whether the
drawer has funds to meet it, can instruct his banker
to forward the cheque in question direct to the
drawer’s bankers, with the request that they telegraph
back whether or not the cheque is paid. Or
he may ask them to wire only in case of non-payment,
and so save himself the expense of a telegram.
Some companies, when they think a customer will
stand it, charge 1<i>s.</i> for doing this; but one should
decline to pay more than the price of the telegram,
viz., 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>Returned and Dishonoured Cheques.</h3>

<p>It does not follow that, because a banker returns a
cheque, the money is not there to meet it, as, more
often than not, a cheque is sent back for some irregularity
in the indorsement, which can be at once put
right. It is necessary, therefore, before jumping to
conclusions, to carefully examine the words written
upon the document. The following are the usual
answers given by bankers, with their abbreviations:</p>

<p>“R/D” (refer to drawer). Such an answer clearly
implies that the cheque has been dishonoured for lack
of funds.</p>

<p>“Effects not cleared.” Here the client, assumably,
has enough money to meet the cheque, but the
banker has not yet cleared or realized the documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he has paid in, and the drawer’s credit is so poor that
he will not honour his cheque until this has been
done. A cheque thus marked is usually re-presented,
but, obviously, the drawer is weak.</p>

<p>“N/S” (not sufficient). We gather from this
that the drawer has some money standing to his
credit, though not enough to meet the cheque.</p>

<p>“Words and figures differ” does not require an
explanation, though, perhaps, it may be remembered
that weak drawers have a trick of making mistakes
in order to gain time. “Payment stopped,” “Post-dated,”
“Incomplete,” “Another signature required,”
“Indorsement irregular,” and other answers
that might be given, are self-explanatory. Cheques
returned for these reasons naturally do not reflect
any discredit upon the drawers. Of course, a person
with an open, charitable mind is free to make his own
deductions.</p>

<p>Occasionally a banker returns a customer’s
cheque when he is in funds. Such a mistake generally
occurs through a credit having been posted to
the wrong account, and as often as not the two customers
are blessed with the same surname, though
not with an equal amount of this world’s goods.
Brown, for instance, is not an uncommon name, so
we will assume that a credit of poor Brown’s has been
posted to rich Brown’s account by mistake, and that
the banker returns the former’s cheque for £50
marked “refer to drawer.” Now poor Mr. Brown
has a good case against his banker, and should at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
once consult his solicitor, who will see that he gets
compensation for the damage done to his credit.
Most bank-directors, who are modest, retiring
gentlemen, prefer to settle such a case privately, as
it is not thought desirable to advertise the fact that a
mistake of this nature, with their perfect system of
book-keeping, is possible.</p>


<h3>Drawer too Ill to Sign.</h3>

<p>In the above instance the customer makes his
mark, which is usually witnessed by his doctor.
Sometimes he authorizes a person to draw cheques
upon his account up to a certain sum, and cancels
the authority upon his recovery.</p>


<h3>Backing a Cheque for a Friend.</h3>

<p>The man who backs a cheque in order to oblige
a friend should remember that he makes himself
responsible for its payment, and that should his
friend have no money to meet it, he, the indorser, will
be called upon to make good the loss. He does not
merely vouch for the respectability of his friend,
but he also guarantees that his cheque will be duly
honoured upon presentation, which is quite another
matter. One should, therefore, decline to back a
cheque for a stranger upon any consideration.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV <br/>
<small><small>CREDIT-ACCOUNT CUSTOMERS</small></small></h2>
</div>


<p>As by far the greater number of a bank’s customers
keep their accounts in credit, we will begin this chapter
by considering what average balance should
entitle a person to have his account worked free of
charge. In London, a man who opens a small account
with a bank, and whose credit balance averages
£100, will not be debited with any commission at the
end of the quarter or half-year when the companies
rule off their books, while in the suburbs an appreciably
smaller balance is accepted, and, occasionally,
interest is allowed there upon current-account
balances, though one will have to press pretty hard
for it. Competition is now so keen between bank
and bank that it is sometimes possible to make very
close terms.</p>

<p>In the country it is considered that an average
balance of £50 upon a small account pays expenses.
However, the bank-manager, who is as human as the
gentleman who sells one a dog, seldom neglects to
make a small charge upon these accounts when he
considers that their owners will stand 10<i>s.</i> a year or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
so. Broadly speaking, you can please yourself
whether you pay it or not. This class of business, of
course, is absolutely safe; so the customer, if he cannot
come to terms with the manager, is able to take
his account to the cheapest market, always remembering
that it is never wise to bank with a second-rate
firm, whatever advantages may be offered.</p>

<p>Though a man keep a balance of £10,000 to his
credit, he will not receive one penny in the shape of
interest unless he ask for it, and, even after having
arranged a rate, it is advisable to check the banker’s
figures and ascertain that you are getting it, as, sometimes,
they are apt to err in his favour, through small
debits that have been deducted from the interest,
and which, consequently, do not appear in your pass-book.</p>

<p>The following illustration, perhaps, will show how
matters stand:—</p>

<p class="pad4">
A keeps an average balance of £150<br />
B keeps an average balance of £600<br />
C keeps an average balance of £5,000<br />
</p>

<p>The banker, if B and C are easy-going men, whose
financial experience is small, will conduct their
accounts on the same terms as he does A’s. He will,
that is to say, work each account free of charge. But
such treatment is evidently unfair, for if A’s account
is worked free, then assuming that those of B and C
give but little more trouble, each is entitled to some
allowance upon his average balance. They should
certainly endeavour to obtain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>If the manager be interviewed, he may endeavour
to convince either B or C, by a process of reasoning,
which is more persuasive than scientific, that money
is so cheap that, really, a high rate is out of the question.
He will further explain that his directors, as
a rule, do not make an allowance upon creditor current
accounts; but should either just hint at
removing his account, a rate will be instantly allowed,
for competition among the banks for a large credit
account is so active that the customer has only to
be firm and fairly reasonable in his demands. The
manager, of course, will endeavour to pay as little as
possible. Of that we may be quite sure. The customer,
on his side, should try to obtain the maximum
rate, which is 1½ per cent. below Bank rate in London,
and in the provinces the usual country rate.</p>

<p>Original sin, not being yet eradicated from our race,
a bank-manager, who is endowed with his full share,
sometimes endeavours to persuade a customer to
transfer sums from his current account to deposit
receipt, but it is always prudent to remember that
his advice is not disinterested, and that he is acting
“upon instructions.” Experience proves that, after
a little while, a customer becomes tired of continually
transferring sums from his running account to
deposit, and then, when his account is getting low,
paying the deposit-receipts to his credit. Finding
the process a weariness to the flesh, he often ends
by giving it up in disgust, when once again the wily
banker is a gainer at his expense. By obtaining a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
rate of interest upon his daily current-account
balances the customer is spared this trouble; and,
if he fail to induce his banker to grant it, then when
his account is in credit beyond a certain agreed sum,
he should take care to get a deposit-receipt.</p>

<p>Bankers, like individuals, are the slaves of their
environment, and in the Midlands and elsewhere,
where it is usual to allow a rate on the daily balances,
commission is also charged on the turn-over or sums
debited. Interest upon the daily creditor balances is
allowed at, say, 1½ per cent. below bank rate, and a
commission of ⅛ per cent. is charged on the cheques
a customer draws. The lower the rate of interest and
the higher the commission rate, the more profitable,
of course, is the account to the banker. The customer,
therefore, when checking his banker’s charges and
allowances, will take care that he is receiving the
maximum rate of interest, and paying the minimum
or lowest commission rate, which varies from ⅛ to ¹/₁₆
per cent., while it is sometimes possible to arrange for
a reduced and merely nominal charge. A person,
when he sees a “little interest” credited in his pass-book,
is disposed to increase his balance, on the
assumption that he is being allowed a rate; but
before doing so he should certainly ascertain what
the rate will be, for, upon examination, this allowance
is occasionally found to appeal more strongly
to one’s senses than to one’s critical acumen.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the paying average credit
balances we can now discuss those accounts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
have a large turn-over. A trader, for instance, who
draws a considerable number of cheques during the
course of a half-year, and whose balance is small,
cannot expect his banker to work his account free of
charge; but it is difficult to draw up a table showing
what he ought to pay, for the simple reason that some
bank-managers debit him with a rate which they
think he will stand. A ¹/₁₆ per cent. commission, that is
to say, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> upon each £100 he draws out by
cheque, seems a very full rate; and as there is a good
market for this class of account he should not disburse
one penny more. The owner, who always has a
balance on the right side, can, if he find his banker
unreasonable, easily negotiate with his rivals, who are
delighted to see fresh faces. Indeed, it is quite possible
that he may succeed in getting his account
worked free, or for a nominal fee of half a guinea
or so, if the turn-over is not very large.</p>

<p>It is now time, perhaps, to give a brief sketch of
the manner in which a manager charges his ledgers at
the end of the quarter or half-year. As a rule he and
the accountant go through the books together; and
as there is no recognized scale by which the charges
are regulated it follows that they consider the man as
well as the nature of his account. The business of
the manager is to make his branch pay; therefore, if
you do not criticize your commission rate, you may
rest assured that he will succeed brilliantly at your
expense. Should he think that the customer lacks
experience, and is not acquainted with the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
competition between bank and bank for creditor
accounts is active, then he charges him ⅛ per cent.
When, on the other hand, he is aware that the client
checks his expenses, caution is exercised; and if the
manager decide to claim commission the sum debited
will be extremely small.</p>

<p>After all, in the ordinary affairs of life one does not
accept without question the price of the seller; and if
a customer be so unwise as to think that a bank-manager
has a higher sense of honour than his kind,
then he must be prepared to take the natural consequences.
For instance, D and E keep an average
balance of £100 in their bankers’ hands, and the turn-over
of each account is about £1,500 for the half-year.
The manager, knowing that D is not critical, charges
him ¹/₁₆ per cent. commission, or 18<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> E, he
asserts, is a most unpleasant man, who, when charged
upon a previous occasion, threatened to remove his
account unless the sum were given back to him; E,
therefore, who is aware that competition is one of the
factors that determine price, has his business done
free.</p>

<p>A large trader or merchant, as a rule, does not allow
his banker to have the use of a considerable amount
of money free of interest; and those accounts that
are from, say, £1,000 to £10,000 in credit, usually belong
to women, who are not accustomed to the management
of money. The manager, anxious to stand
well with his directors, some of whom increase his
salary if he add to the profits of his branch, does not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of course, suggest to these ladies the advisability of
receiving interest upon at least a portion of their
balances, but, on the contrary, being wise in his
generation, endeavours, by resorting to those social
amenities that raise him higher and higher in their
estimation, to hide the awkward word from their
view, while laughing in his sleeve at their excessive
credulity.</p>

<p>The customer who keeps his account in credit
should ask his banker: “What average balance
must I maintain in order that your people will work
my account free?” That sum ascertained, he can
act upon the advice contained in this chapter.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V <br/>
<small><small>DEPOSIT-RECEIPT CUSTOMERS</small></small></h2>
</div>


<p>A deposit-receipt, which is not a negotiable instrument,
cannot be transferred by one person to another.
Where the receipt is issued in more than one name,
instructions should be given to the banker as to
whether, in the event of withdrawal, the note is to be
signed by all or by any two or any one of the depositors.
Should no instructions be given, then all must
sign when a withdrawal is made, or when the interest
is taken. These receipts, as a rule, are issued subject
to either seven or fourteen days’ notice of withdrawal;
but the notice, in practice, is not enforced, bankers
merely writing it upon the note in order to protect
themselves in the event of a run. Most banks, however,
decline to pay interest unless the sum has remained
in their possession for at least one month.</p>

<p>The large London banks, though they compete
eagerly the one against the other for well-secured
advances and loans, have closed up their ranks
against the depositor, their practice being, both in
London and the suburbs, to allow 1½ per cent. below
Bank rate upon money left with them on deposit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
every alteration in the rate being advertised in the
leading papers. All one has to do, therefore, in order
to ascertain the London rate for money on deposit-receipt
is to deduct 1½ from the Bank of England rate
which may be seen in the city-article of every newspaper.
Whether or not certain banks offer special
rates to favoured individuals is a matter of opinion;
or, again, they may bid higher for large sums for fixed
terms; but the small depositor may take it for
granted that, with their rates on loans and advances
reduced by competition among themselves, the banks
are determined to keep down the deposit rate. In
fact, the large London bankers have united for this
very purpose, though it must be remembered that the
agreement is not binding at the country branches of
the London and provincial institutions.</p>

<p>A banker is a middleman who borrows from depositors
at a rate in order that he may lend to others
at a higher rate, the difference between the two rates
being his margin of gross profit. A certain portion of
his deposits, we know, he obtains in exchange for
granting banking facilities, and upon the rest he
allows a rate of interest, while he has to maintain a
reserve of so-called cash and gilt-edged securities
against the danger of sudden withdrawals and panics.
At the moment the companies cannot control the
advance rate, or fix from time to time a minimum
rate for secured advances; but in London we see
that they have succeeded in getting the depositor
under their thumb, thereby, of course, increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
their profit margin at his expense. Their next move
will probably be an attempt to corner the borrower
against tangible securities, as has been successfully
accomplished by the banks in Scotland. The number
of English banks is rapidly decreasing through absorptions
and amalgamations, so, in the end, it is more
than probable that we shall see a monopoly, and that
all the large banks will one day unite for the purpose
of fixing, at each change of the Bank rate, their deposit
rate, and, also, their lowest or minimum rate
for secured advances.</p>

<p>In the provinces the banks, when loanable capital
is cheap, are able to lend and to discount at higher
rates than in London, so the country deposit rate
never falls so low as that of London. Neither, however,
does it advance so high when loanable capital is
dear, because the provincial banks then find some
difficulty in increasing their rates upon bills and loans
proportionately. The following table will enable one
to see the difference between the rate allowed in London
and the country:—</p>

<p>In the country, we must remember, there is no combination
or ring of bankers who meet to decide the
rate, which, therefore, is not “fixed” from time to
time on the basis of the Bank rate, though, of course,
the country deposit rate moves up and down in
sympathy with the Bank of England’s published rate
of discount or official minimum, as it is called. There
is, moreover, some competition for deposits in the
country, but it is very slight; and, unless the banker
think that a man may be useful, he seldom bids
appreciably higher than his rivals for his money.
The small private banker, it is true, may offer more
interest, but a depositor should take care to examine
his balance-sheet before he entrusts him with either
his spare capital or his savings.</p>

<p>A few of the purely provincial joint-stock banks,
whose branches are situated in a manufacturing
centre, and which, in consequence, are never overburdened
with working resources, offer higher rates
than the great companies, but they are the weaker of
their kind, and it is therefore questionable whether
one should lend to them. In every probability one’s
principal would be safe, but it would not be <i>so</i> safe as
in the hands of the really large London and provincial
institutions, whose reserves afford the customer a
much better guarantee; consequently it is always
wise to consider whether the additional risk, be it
never so small, is worth taking for the slight increase
in the rate.</p>

<p>Of course the country depositor will take care to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
inquire what rates the other large banks in his town
are granting, so that he may judge whether his own
banker is allowing him a fair rate. Again, if the
amount of his deposit be, say, over £1,000, he can
sometimes obtain a special rate; and he may rest
quite assured that, if he do not interest himself in the
matter, the bank-manager will allow him the lowest
rate possible, for as there is not a fixed minimum it
follows that some, more especially during certain conditions
of the market, are obtaining better rates than
others. A little pressure will occasionally induce the
manager to quote, as he quaintly calls it, a “special”
rate of interest, if he consider the customer’s name be
worth keeping on his books. It may be added that
some people, in order to minimize their risk, keep
their current accounts with one banker and deposit
with another.</p>

<p>We can now refer to the table of rates on page 48.
The country rate, of course, is stated approximately,
for we have seen that under certain conditions the
customer may possibly obtain more. Glancing at the
table, we find that when the bank rate is at 2, the
London depositor receives ½ per cent. and the country
depositor 1½. If the London customer deal with a
London and provincial bank, it will obviously pay
him better to deposit at one of the country branches.
He should, therefore, if he consider that money is
likely to be cheap for some considerable time, give
notice in London and transfer his deposit to the
country. If his banker object, he can deposit with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
any large, well-managed provincial bank. With the
Bank rate at 2½ the move would pay him, but when
it rises above these figures the rate is either equal or
in his favour. A person who keeps two banking
accounts, one in London and the other in the country,
can make this move with the greatest of ease; and by
transferring his deposit from the one to the other as
the rate favours him, he may easily increase his interest.
Conversely, with a high bank rate it may pay
the country depositor to transfer his principal to
London. There is no occasion to let the banker see
the move.</p>

<p>In London and the great cities a large proportion
of the deposits at interest, especially during periods
of depression, would represent capital temporarily
withdrawn from trade, and awaiting either more
profitable investment or an increased demand and
rising prices. It is this accumulation of idle capital
that tempts the company-promoter from his lair, and
sometimes results in a Stock Exchange boom, whilst
it always produces an increased demand for the so-called
gilt-edged variety of securities and a consequent
rise in their price. The country depositor, however,
even when he leaves fairly large sums at interest, is
generally waiting to invest his money in house
property, which will return him from 5 to 6 per cent.,
or to place it out on a first mortgage at from 3½ to 4
per cent. In the first instance, he is careful not to
purchase old property that will swallow up much of
his rent in repairs. Cautious by nature, he shakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his head dubiously at the glowing prospectus of the
promoter, and refuses to believe in the high-toned
and cunningly tuned leaflets with which the bucket-shops
favour him, for he likes to see his investment,
to feel it, to walk upon it. Paper does not satisfy
his soul; he is not even without his suspicions of
banker’s paper; but when he possesses house property,
then all he has to fear is the Almighty and a
bad earthquake, and he can sleep comfortably on
those risks.</p>

<p>Country depositors consist largely of working
men, clerks, artisans, small shopkeepers, dressmakers,
women of slender means, and so on, together with
the banks’ current-account customers. The huge
aggregate of deposits is made up principally of small
sums, so it is easy to keep down the rate, because the
great majority are ignorant of the condition of the
money-market, and hardly seem to be aware that the
Post Office gives 2½ per cent. upon small sums left
with it. The companies trade upon the ignorance of
their depositors; and though a few of the better-informed
customers withdraw their savings when
the rate is extremely low, experience has taught
the banks that the great bulk of them simply
grumble and take what is offered.</p>

<p>Seeing that the deposits are spread over so great
an area, and among men and women who have not
sufficient business knowledge to invest their savings
advantageously, the banks have been able to keep
down rates without reducing their own resources;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and the few who do withdraw their savings when the
deposit rate is at 1½ per cent. are practically of small
account when contrasted with the alternative policy
the companies would have to adopt in order to retain
them, for it obviously pays better to lose a few receipts
than to raise the rate to 2 for the whole of the
deposits. For instance, a bank would rather lose
£100,000 by withdrawals when the rate is at 1½ than
pay 2 per cent. on £5,000,000 for the purpose of preventing
the drain, £25,000 being too large a premium
to sacrifice for the purpose of retaining its connexion
intact, when, perhaps, money is being employed in
the London shortloan market at 1½ per cent. and
under.</p>

<p>Again, very many of the country depositors look
upon the deposit-receipt as an investment, and the
banks, quite naturally, do not wish to inform them
that even Consols are a more profitable one. Not so
very many years ago the country minimum deposit
rate was 2, and it was not without certain misgivings
that it was reduced to 1½; but, as we have seen, the
experiment proved safe, though the banks, given
another long period of a 2 per cent. Bank rate, will
hardly care to risk 1 per cent. in the provinces, as
it seems pretty certain that, were the minimum
further reduced, disgusted depositors would invest
their savings either in the Post Office or the gilt-edged
class of securities. Having once turned this
stream of deposits into another channel, it is improbable
that a higher rate would tempt them back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
again; and as the depositor is essential to the modern
banking system, the provincial banks will think
many times before they risk a rate below 1½, even
when cheap capital is again reducing their dividends
right and left.</p>

<p>A customer, before leaving his money with a
banker, will be careful to inquire what rate he is to
receive, and if the rate be not written upon the
receipt, then he might pencil the answer he gets upon
the back of the document. If there be three good
banks in his town, and he has, say, £200 to deposit,
there can be no harm in his going to all, and asking
the highest rate each is allowing. John Jones, we
will assume, holds a deposit-receipt for £200 dated
10th June and he takes it to the bank on 9th
December following in order to draw the interest
at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum. Between
10th June (excluding the first day) to 9th December
(inclusive) there are 182 days, so the banker owes
him 2 per cent. per annum on £200 for 182 days.
Hence the following sum:—</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdc bb">200 × 2 × 182</td>
<td rowspan="2"> = £1 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">100 × 365</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The cashier, therefore, pays John Jones £1 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
in cash, and gives him a new receipt, dated 9th
December, for £200. A depositor, as a rule, draws
his interest twice a year. Some persons, however,
leave their receipts from three to five years without
disturbing them; and the bank-manager, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
anxious to swell the profits of his branch, is careful,
when they are presented, to make his calculations at
simple interest instead of at compound. Deposit
customers, therefore, even when they do not require
the interest due to them, should present their receipts
six months after date in order to have the interest
added to the principal, when both bear interest
together.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming that John Jones had not
required his interest, then he would have taken a new
note for £201 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>; but Mr. Jones, who is
acquainted with the internal economies of a bank,
and who is also aware of the intense frugality of the
agent, knows that the companies do not allow interest
upon the odd shillings of a deposit-receipt; so, giving
the cashier an additional twopence, he takes a fresh
note for £202, and walks away very well satisfied with
himself. Were he to omit taking this precaution
each half-year, and to hold his receipt for, say, five
years, then, when he took it in, he would merely get
certain rates upon £200 for five years. The larger
the principal the greater, of course, is the loss of
interest to the depositor.</p>

<p>Should not the depositor reside in the neighbourhood
he can, after the expiration of six months, write
his name on the back of the note and send it through
the post to his banker, with the request that a new
receipt be returned to him for the amount of the principal
and interest. In the event of his wishing to
draw the interest, a banker will send him either a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
draft or postal orders for the amount due to him, as
he may direct. Of course, if he at any time require
part of the principal, he will state what amount, and
give directions whether the interest is to be added to
the new receipt for the balance or to be included with
the sum he is withdrawing, while he will take care
to write his name upon the back of the note before
despatching it. When sending a receipt by a
messenger it is usual to write a note to the banker,
telling him just what one requires and requesting
him to pay the bearer of the letter.</p>

<p>Where interest amounting to £2 and over is withdrawn,
the deposit-receipt must have on the back
a penny postage stamp, which the depositor should
cancel by writing his name across it. This must
be done upon each note when the depositor has a
plurality of receipts. Where, however, the interest
upon any one is less than £2, a stamp is unnecessary.
Nor is it required when the depositor adds principal
and interest together and takes a fresh note for the
aggregate, but where principal and interest or principal
or interest amounting to £2 or over is <i>withdrawn</i>,
the receipt must bear a penny stamp.</p>

<p>We now come to the question of the seven or fourteen
days’ notice on these receipts, and, as previously
stated, the banker seldom or never enforces his
claim, though, when notice is not given, he occasionally
deducts fourteen days if the whole of the principal
be withdrawn. When this is contemplated it is
better, perhaps, to give the necessary notice, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
manager, should the customer protest against this
deduction, generally gives way. Again, if the note
be for £100, and the depositor withdraw £50, and
take a new receipt for the balance, the banker may
deduct a certain number of days from the term on £50
(the sum withdrawn without notice). The customer,
by checking his interest, will discover this loss,
which the teller, if he remonstrated with him, will
obligingly make good. It is also as well to bear in
mind that some banks have two rates.</p>

<p>The London depositor, we know, receives 1½ below
Bank rate; so assuming that Mr. Jones, of Whitechapel,
held a note for £200, dated 5th February,
1903, and took it to the bank to draw the interest on
5th July of the same year, he would want to know
how much was due to him at the latter date. First,
therefore, he must ascertain whether any changes
were made in the Bank rate during the period in
question; and upon inquiry he found that the
“official minimum” was raised to 4 per cent. on
2nd October, 1902, and lowered to 3½ on 21st May
following, and to 3 upon the 18th June next.</p>

<p>Now, from 5th February (exclusive) to 5th July
(inclusive) there are 150 days. His banker, therefore,
owed him:—</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, of Whitechapel, then, should have received
£1 17<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> from his banker in cash and a fresh deposit-receipt,
dated the 5th July, 1903, for £200. At
each change of the bank rate the London depositor,
when calculating his interest, must make a fresh sum,
as in the above illustration, and so, too, must the
country depositor when the fluctuation of the Bank
of England rate is sufficiently wide to influence the
rate of interest allowed in the provinces, though the
latter must remember that he can only ascertain the
rate by making inquiries of the bankers themselves
or among those of his friends who deposit with them.</p>

<p>Adverting to the dates in the foregoing illustration,
a few words of explanation are perhaps
necessary, for it will be seen that under the heading
“Bank rate was,” 21st May and 18th June, the days
upon which the official minimum was changed, are
placed opposite different rates. The Bank of England
directors examine their weekly return or
balance-sheet, which is made up to the close of
business each Wednesday on the Thursday following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and in the afternoon of the latter day any change in
the Bank’s rate of discount is announced. Of course,
during abnormal times the rates may be changed on
any day as the exigencies of the moment may direct;
but, fortunately, though the money-market is subject
to fits, its surface, as a rule, is seldom so violently
perturbed as to call for drastic remedies, and we shall
find that the dates in question were Thursdays. It
follows, therefore, that these days opened with the
bank rate at one figure and closed with it at another.
Hence the anomaly to which attention has been
drawn. The banker owed Mr. Jones, of Whitechapel,
interest at 2½ per cent. from 5th February
(exclusive) to 21st May (inclusive). On the 21st
May, we know, the Bank rate was reduced from 4
to 3½ per cent.; so he owed him 2 per cent. on his
principal from 21st May (exclusive) to 18th June
(inclusive)—the date of the next change. Should not
the reason of this be quite clear to any reader, if he
remember that from 21st to 22nd May the Bank rate
would have been one day at 3½ per cent. the difficulty
will probably disappear.</p>

<p>From an investment point of view the deposit-receipt
seems hardly worth consideration, because
even Consols, over a period of five years, will return
an appreciably higher yield; but when one is merely
waiting for a suitable investment to turn up, or for
a revival of trade, then the deposit-note exactly
meets one’s requirements, for its only charm lies in
the fact that the depositor gets back his principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
intact. When the deposit rate is low trade is generally
dull, and the prices of gilt-edged securities consequently
move up. The depositor, therefore, when the
rate is high should not be tempted to let his money
remain with his banker for that reason alone, because
he can then, as a rule, buy gilt-edged securities at
cheaper figures, and, needless to say, the average
return on his purchase-money will greatly exceed the
average rate of interest on deposit. Conversely, if he
buy the so-called gilt-edged variety of securities when
interest is low, he is much more liable to a loss of
capital should he want to realize them when trade is
good and the rate of interest high. It follows that
the man of business, who finds capital accumulating
in his hands during periods of temporary depression,
when interest, of course, is low, prefers taking a
deposit-receipt for his idle capital, which he hopes to
again use in his business directly markets improve, to
purchasing, say, Consols at a time when demand
has enhanced their price, and, consequently, added
to his risk of loss upon realization.</p>

<p>Some banks, instead of issuing a deposit-receipt for
money left at interest, give the depositor a pass-book,
in which the sum he leaves is credited. Each time
the depositor leaves new money he takes his book
with him, and the cashier enters the amount therein
to his credit, while he draws out his interest, or any
part of the principal he may require, by cheque. As
the banker rules off his deposit-ledgers half-yearly,
and then adds the interest due to each customer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
principal, it follows that principal and interest, when
the balance is brought forward, give a return to the
customer, who by this method receives compound interest
on his capital or savings. The advantages of
this system are too obvious to call for explanation,
but it may be added that, when a deposit customer is
given a cheque-book, he should be careful not to
operate too freely upon his account, as some bankers
then transfer the balance to their current-account
ledgers, their reason being that the account has
ceased to be used for the purpose for which it was
opened, and that, therefore, the depositor is no
longer entitled to interest.</p>

<p>The chapter on “Unclaimed Balances” should
prove especially interesting to depositors.</p>

<small><small>THE BANK RATE IN RELATION TO BANKERS’ CHARGES</small></small></h2>
</div>


<p>Very many persons who are out of touch with
money-market problems fail to see why the Bank of
England’s rate of discount should be in any way connected
with a banker’s charges; and though, to
those who have not studied the question, the swaying
of the pendulum seems due to some occult influence,
the forces that move it are both visible to the naked
eye and capable of explanation. In the first place,
the Bank of England keeps the cash reserves of all the
banks in the United Kingdom, and, as a natural consequence,
possesses the only large store of gold in the
land. The other banks, which are dependent upon
this accumulation, become nervous immediately the
gold in the Bank’s vaults begins to leave the country
in appreciable quantities, because, should not the
Bank of England be able to meet their demands,
they, too, will be unable to supply the requirements
of their own customers.</p>

<p>We need not, in a small book of this description,
enter into the mysteries of the foreign exchanges, or
discuss internal and external drains of gold, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Bank, in order to arrest a drain of gold outwards,
raises its rate, when the other banking companies,
equally anxious to stop the efflux, raise their rates
too, with the result that borrowers, whether upon
bills or securities, have to pay more. Conversely,
when the Bank’s reserve is high and the political
horizon unclouded this nervous feeling no longer
exists. The Bank, we will assume, then lowers its
rate, and the other banks follow suit, when the
borrower pays less.</p>

<p>When speaking of the money-market, the London
money-market is always implied, and here we encounter
the bill-brokers to whom the banks advance
their surplus funds. The banks, that is to say,
finance their rivals, who make bills a speciality, and
whose knowledge of bills of exchange is doubtless
both extensive and peculiar. Seeing that the banks
themselves discount trade-bills for their customers,
the necessity of a middleman or bill-broker between
the person who discounts a bill and the banker who
supplies the capital is not very apparent, but the
broker’s “turn,” when he re-discounts with the
banks, is extremely small; so it is quite possible that
were the banks to establish special departments to
deal with this business, the slight increase in their
rates would not compensate them sufficiently for the
troubles of management. As, under this system,
the brokers’ rate of discount is below that of the
banks, it follows that all the bank-bills and most of
the best trade-bills pass through the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
bill-brokers, while bills are also sent to them from all
the great cities. The bankers, consequently, discount
inferior paper at higher rates for their own
customers.</p>

<p>But the Bank of England is a great bank of discount.
Moreover, it pays a dividend like any other
bank, and, as the bill-brokers are its rivals, it follows
that it cannot afford to allow all the business to drift
into their hands. When, therefore, the brokers’ rate
(the market rate) is below its own, it either takes
steps to make its own rate of discount, as the saying
is, “effective,” or else it reduces its advertised rate of
discount (the Bank rate). The Bank makes its rate
representative or effective by selling Consols, and
thereby reducing “bankers’ balances.” The banks
in consequence have less to lend to the brokers, who
are then bound to apply to the Bank of England,
which compels them to discount their bills at its own
terms, and the rate in the outside market, of course,
advances.</p>

<p>We can see, therefore, that though the Bank rate is
sometimes either above or below the market rate, it is
necessarily never out of touch with it for any very considerable
length of time; so now, perhaps, it will be
understood why the banks allow 1½ below Bank rate
on deposit; and their reason for basing their rate
for loans and advances upon the Bank of England’s
advertised rate of discount will also be apparent.</p>

<p>Of course, the demand for, and the supply of,
loanable capital decides the rate of interest, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
demand and supply are never equal, the rate is always
fluctuating, but we might just remember that our
artificial banking system “influences” the rate from
time to time. During periods of dull trade, when
loanable capital accumulates in the hands of the
banking companies, we should expect to see a low
Bank rate, because, prices of commodities having
fallen, people are less anxious to borrow, while fewer
bills are on offer, and, the demand for those bills
having increased proportionately, it follows that the
holders can discount them at a cheap rate. But
when business is brisk and the prices of commodities
are rising, more bills are drawn, and as the fund
with which they are discounted is not limitless, it
follows that the increasing demand upon that fund
sends up the rate. Bankers, consequently, who
have also to meet the requirements of their current-account
customers, are sometimes obliged to administer
a salutary check to speculation by making the
rate almost prohibitive in order to protect their
reserves of cash, as if they then lent to all and sundry
even Lombard Street would collapse.</p>

<p>Now the Bank of England, we have seen, holds the
national reserve, as it were, and is, in consequence,
the pillar upon which the money-market rests.
Threadneedle Street (the Bank) is, therefore, the
centre of the money-market (hence the description
“central institution”) into which Lombard Street
(the rest of the banks in the United Kingdom) pours
its reserve and surplus cash. We might describe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Bank as the heart of the money-market, through
which a stream of cash and credit-documents is continually
flowing. The brokers (the outside market),
who practically keep no reserves of cash, are largely
financed by Lombard Street, which, however, calls
in its advances to them during certain conditions
of the market; and the bill-brokers are then compelled
to fall back upon the Bank of England which
holds the bankers’ reserves. In assisting the brokers
the Bank is also supporting the credit of Lombard
Street; so, clearly, the interests of each division are
identical; and the closer and more friendly the
relations between them the smoother will be the surface
of the money-market.</p>

<p>But we have to consider the Bank rate in relation
to bankers’ charges; and here another factor must be
introduced, to wit, the nature of the securities deposited
by the customer. The business man’s favourite
investments are English railways, Corporation
Stocks, Industrial Companies, and so on, whilst occasionally,
endowed with imagination, and recognizing
how erratically the earth dispenses her favours,
the blessed uncertainty of mines appeals to his gambling
instinct. As a rule, a banker’s loans and
advances are not covered by Consols, because it
would pay the borrower better to sell out and place
the sum they realized to his credit. Advances
against Consols would be made principally to stockbrokers
and to speculators who had bought them
largely in the hope of a rise in price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Competition for an advance, which is covered by
tangible securities, is keen both in London and the
provinces, and competition, we must remember, tends
to reduce the rate. Then, again, assuming that the
Bank rate be 3 per cent., and that a banker suggests
4 per cent. on an advance covered by railway debentures,
the customer may not see the force of maintaining
a margin of 10 per cent. between the market-price
of his stock for the protection of his banker,
and paying him, say, ¾ per cent. more than his
securities return on his purchase-money. As the
customer’s loan or advance is well secured, and as the
banker will only advance to the extent of 90 per cent.
of the market-price on the condition aforesaid, he is
only willing to pay Bank rate upon the sum he
borrows.</p>

<p>We next have to consider the amount of pressure
the customer can bring to bear on his banker, of
whom his securities make him practically independent.
He may, in the first place, threaten to remove
his account unless his banker grant him a loan at 3½.
Secondly, he may decide that it will pay him better
to sell his debentures at the market-price. Again
he may only require the loan for a few months or even
weeks; and as, in his opinion, the debentures will
probably appreciate in value, he may decide to pay
4 per cent. for a short period to either selling out or
troubling to find a cheaper market. Obviously, the
higher the Bank rate advances the less disposed is
this class of customer to pay ½ per cent. above it; so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
when the official minimum is at 5 and 6, he can often
arrange for an advance at Bank rate or even at a ½
below it. On the other hand, the banker, when
Bank rate is at 2 or 2½, generally refuses to lend at
less than 3 per cent. per annum. The rate, therefore,
upon a secured advance is influenced by the
nature of the cover deposited as well as by the state
of the money-market.</p>

<p>This description of the market is, of course, the
veriest sketch, but, perhaps, it may possibly prove
somewhat enlightening to those who have hitherto
regarded this very simple subject as an exceptionally
difficult one.</p>

<small><small>LOANS AND ADVANCES IN LONDON</small></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We are told that London banking is quite different
to country banking, but it is a difference of degree
rather than of kind, and in London, as in the provinces,
the bank-manager has two rates—one for
those who, taking him at his word, do not attempt
to bate him down, and a second and lower rate for
those persons who, knowing that he is of the City,
and scenting instinctively a servant of the company,
who is in possession of instructions, literally force
his hand. A seller in a free market where competition
is vigorous generally has at least two prices,
though, of course, he only advertises one of them,
and the banks, which are not one whit in advance of
the commercial ethics of the times, base their rate
upon expediency as well as upon the Bank of England’s
rate of discount. In stating so human and
obvious a fact one can only apologize for its intense
triteness, and urge, in extenuation, the blind, unreasoning
faith of some people in the modern bank-manager.
Such faith may be beautiful, but, believe
me, it is costly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Mention has been made of the distinctions between
country and London banking, and one of these
appears to be the adoption of the “loan-account”
system by the City banks, but “loan accounts” are
not by any means unknown in the provinces, though
the opening of them is exceptional. Moreover, though
this system is greatly in evidence at the head-offices
of the joint-stock banks, the farther one moves away
from Lombard Street the less firmly is it established,
and one finds in the books of the London branch
banks a medley of the two systems. That is to say,
some customers adopt the “loan-account,” and others
pay a rate upon their daily debtor balances, together
with a commission on the turn-over of their accounts.</p>

<p>When a “loan account” is opened by a customer,
the banks do not charge a commission upon his
current account, but, as we shall see, neither do they
neglect to make amends for this omission. A customer,
we will suppose, when the Bank rate is at 3
per cent. obtains a loan of £20,000 from his banker
at Bank rate. He draws a cheque for this sum,
which the banker debits to a “loan account” in his
name, then places £20,000 to the credit of his current
or running account. Now the interest at the rate
of, say, 3 per cent. is calculated on the loan account,
so if the customer’s average credit balance for the
half-year amounts to about £4,000, then he has paid
3 per cent. per annum upon £4,000 which he has
never used. In other words, he has given his banker
something like £60 for working his account during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the half-year. Further, some London banks charge a
commission of ⅛ per cent. on the amount of the loan.
This they add each half-year to his interest, which, in
the present instance, would be debited in his current
account pass-book thus: To Interest, £325. By
carefully checking his banker’s charges he will make
this discovery, and, of course, promptly demand that
£25 be returned to him.</p>

<p>It can now be seen that the London bank-manager
is as eager to snatch a commission as his country
<i>confrère</i>, and, moreover, that he is not without his
opportunities, which, when the client is considered
safe, he seldom neglects. In other words, he does his
duty like other honest folk whose misfortune it is to
be employees; and he does not specify the ⅛ per cent.
on £20,000 in the pass-book for the simple reason that
he knows it is safer disguised as interest.</p>

<p>The customer naturally does not see why he should
pay a rate upon £4,000 which he has not wanted, and
which, in reality, the banker has not lent, though he
has created credit in his own books to that extent by
two simple entries on the debit and credit side of his
ledgers. Assuming that no commission was charged
on the loan, £60 a half-year seems a large sum to pay
him for working an account, especially as most of his
rivals will bid against him for a well-secured loan.
The customer, therefore, should insist upon receiving
the same rate upon his daily creditor current-account
balances as he is paying upon his loan, and if he consider
that his banker is entitled to a commission for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
working his account, then he can arrange for a fair
nominal charge, but he may succeed in getting it
worked free. Again, when his current account is
largely in credit, he can transfer a certain sum therefrom
to his loan account, and, by moving balances
from the one to the other, as occasion may arise, save
himself an appreciable sum in the shape of interest;
but he may be too busy to adopt this course, and it
is evident that the first suggestion, which is better
adapted to his wants, will save him both time and
money. Naturally the banker will object, but the
client will make it his business to endeavour to overcome
such opposition, which will be either strong or
weak in proportion to the nature of his cover and the
desirability of retaining his account.</p>

<p>We next come to the rate a borrower should pay
upon a well-secured loan or advance, and here, again,
we may touch upon a distinction between London and
country banking. A banker, like any other dealer,
adapts his business to his surroundings, but in a great
city like London he is practically compelled to
specialize more or less, and but little money is lent
in the City upon mortgage, whereas overdrafts are
granted freely in the country against the deeds of
house property. Of course there are exceptions;
and certain well-known firms, whose credit is beyond
question, may not even be asked for any security
when they borrow at certain times of the year, but
they soon would be if the loan began to assume a permanent
character; for though a banker may be will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ing
to advance to an influential and reputable firm
without cover just at those seasons when demand
upon it is heaviest, he assumes that such assistance
will only be required temporarily, and would instantly
become nervous should it appear from his
books that the firm was slower than usual in reducing
the loan, whilst immediately he perceived that a
certain amount of it threatened to take the form of
a permanent advance he would ask for security.</p>

<p>The City banks are too busy to give much attention
to the wants of the small man of business, and,
broadly speaking, they require marketable securities
before they will grant a loan or advance. The suburban
manager, however, who is only on the edge of
this struggling mass of humanity, views the smaller
applicant with a kindlier eye, because the large
borrower seldom approaches him, so in the suburbs
one can borrow on mortgage just as one can in the
country. Indeed, suburban banking approximates
very closely to country banking, the one noticeable
distinction being the deposit rate. The West-end
banker, again, has his peculiarities, and it by no
means follows that the rules and regulations of a
bank’s head-office in the City are in complete harmony
with those of one of its branches within a
quarter of an hour’s walk of the seat of government.
It is, therefore, impossible to define London banking,
because London is vast, and the system eminently
elastic and adaptable.</p>

<p>The following table will give one a fair idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
what rate should be paid upon a loan or advance,
fully covered by securities which can be sold on the
Stock Exchange practically at any moment:—</p>

<p>
With Bank rate at 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % Customer pays 2½ to 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %<br />
With Bank rate at 2½ % Customer pays 2½ to 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %<br />
With Bank rate at 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % Customer pays 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 3½ %<br />
With Bank rate at 3½ % Customer pays 3½ to 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %<br />
With Bank rate at 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % Customer pays 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 4½ %<br />
With Bank rate at 4½ % Customer pays 4½ to 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %<br />
With Bank rate at 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % Customer pays 4½ to 5½ %<br />
With Bank rate at 5½ % Customer pays 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %<br />
With Bank rate at 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % Customer pays 5½ to 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %<br />
</p>

<p>It must be distinctly understood that this table will
only serve the purpose of a guide to what the rate
ought to be, and that the customer can, if his credit be
good, by bringing pressure to bear upon his banker,
very probably make a closer bargain with him. For
instance, with the Bank rate at 4½, a person whose
securities and credit are beyond question might obtain
a loan at ½ below Bank rate. He may further
arrange that his rate shall be ½ per cent. below Bank
rate, with a minimum to the banker of 3 or 3½. That
is to say, his rate will never be less than 3 or 3½,
and when the Bank rate is above 3½, then he pays ½
below it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the customer who accepts the
rate mentioned by the manager without question
fares badly, for no dealer quotes his minimum rate
first. He reserves that, as is usual in the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
financial circles, until last, and he finds it difficult to
look pleased when it is forced from him, because his
directors, if he quoted it too often, may come to the
conclusion that his hand is losing its cunning. The
client will have to do more than ask in order that he
receive: he must use argument that is convincing.
Knowing that certain bank-managers are running
about the City in search of desirable accounts, just as
are bill-brokers for first-class paper, he not unnaturally
comes to the conclusion that he can find a cheaper
market elsewhere, so, having exhausted the gentler
modes of suasion, the client finally and reluctantly
threatens to apply elsewhere, or reveals the fact
that he has already done so, and with what result,
when the manager, if he think him in earnest, quotes
his very lowest rate, and asks him not to mention it
outside. Where the loan is a small one, however, the
directors will not trouble themselves greatly as to
whether it either goes or remains.</p>

<p>The much-vaunted 1 per cent. above Bank rate is,
of course, only paid by the small man, whose securities
are not of the better class, and by the customer
who has not studied the market. Some London
banks, we know, charge a rate on the daily balances
and a commission, but this is the ordinary country
practice, so, in order to avoid reiteration, it has been
thought desirable to discuss the method in the next
chapter.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII <br/>
<small><small>OVERDRAFTS IN THE COUNTRY</small></small></h2>
</div>


<p>In the preceding chapter we discussed the “loan
account” and its mysteries, and now we are brought
face to face with the country practice of granting the
customer a “limit.” The banker, we will assume,
agrees that, upon his depositing certain securities, he
<i>may</i> overdraw his current account to the extent of
£1,500. This sum, then, is the client’s “limit”
which he is not supposed to exceed, and if he draw a
cheque that would, when presented for payment,
overdraw his account beyond the agreed figures were
the banker to honour it, the latter is entitled to
return the document without notice. As a rule a
bank reserves to itself the right of calling in a loan
or advance at any moment, but in practice reasonable
notice is always given.</p>

<p>Though the customer has arranged for a “limit”
of, say, £1,500, it is quite possible that he will not
overdraw his account to that extent; but at those
seasons of the year when his outgoings are always in
excess of his receipts the balance against him at the
bank will draw closer to his limit. If, however, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
business be in a healthy condition the corner will
soon be turned; and as his payments in begin to
exceed the cheques he draws, his indebtedness to the
bank speedily sinks below the average. Each payment
to his credit reduces his debit balance, and
every cheque debited, of course, increases it, but as
the banker charges him a rate upon the sum owing
at the end of each day, it follows that the customer
only pays interest upon the actual money he has
borrowed—not upon the amount of the “limit”
as does the London client upon the amount of his
“loan.” This arrangement is much the fairer to
the borrower, who, however, must take care that the
banker do not charge him a high rate of commission
upon his turn-over under it.</p>

<p>We can now consider the rate of interest a customer
should pay on an advance which is more than covered
by marketable securities that can be sold on the
Stock Exchange at a moment’s notice. Most provincial
towns, we know, are over-banked; and as
each banker is the rival of the rest it follows that a
person whose cover is tangible can, by playing off
the one against the other, obtain very fine rates.
But he may not care to adopt these tactics; still, as
the method may appeal to some, it would be a pity
not to dwell upon its possibilities, for it is often
undoubtedly effective where argument fails. The
would-be borrower of this class may be referred to
the table of rates in Chapter VII, and to the remarks
made concerning well-secured advances in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
as, competition for a secured overdraft being even
more keen in the country, where tangible securities
are less in evidence, he should experience little
difficulty in coming to a similar arrangement with
reference to the rate of interest.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose a man who possesses a good
list of marketable stocks and shares wishes to borrow
£5,000 from his banker, and calls upon the branch-manager,
who at once expresses the opinion that his
directors will have no hesitation in granting his request.
They next discuss terms. The manager, who
is a humble servant of the company, and who, moreover
is anxious to pass the rest of his days in that
honourable capacity, looks at his customer, thinking
hard the while, and then, trusting his man lacks
business experience, suggests 5 per cent. per annum
on the overdraft and ⅛ per cent. on the turn-over.
The turn-over of an account consists of the cheques,
bills, etc., debited during the quarter or half-year,
and the customer, therefore, is asked to pay a commission
of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> upon each £100 debited in his
pass-book. There is nothing very remarkable in
this request on the part of a dealer in cash and
credit who is selling his wares, and to express surprise
is to display a lack of knowledge of business
procedure, but to agree to his proposals would betoken
a lamentable ignorance of the market.</p>

<p>Should the Bank rate be at 4 per cent. the customer
would endeavour not to pay more, for his securities
do not give him that return, and he has the option of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
selling them. And as to paying a rate on his turn-over,
he knows that if he make application elsewhere
he can probably find a banker who will forego that
charge, so he either refuses to entertain it or else
agrees to pay a merely nominal sum. With a higher
Bank rate than 4, he will try to obtain his advance
at ½ below the official minimum; and if the Bank
rate be low, and loanable capital therefore cheap
at the moment, he can suggest “½ per cent.
below Bank rate with a minimum of 3½.” Here,
again, reference may be made to the previous chapter.
Of course, if there are only two banks in his
town, and consequently but little competition, he
will not find the manager so ready to listen to him,
but he certainly should not pay more than Bank rate
when it is above 3½, while he will remember that the
manager’s advice, if he be so rash as to express an
opinion, is not disinterested.</p>

<p>We next come to the customer whose “limit” is
covered by marketable securities and deeds of house
property or land. The banker will have the property
valued by his own man, and then perhaps advance
up to about two-thirds of the value placed upon it
after the deeds have been examined by the bank’s
solicitor and formally deposited, the customer, of
course, paying all expenses. The securities, if they
are a fairly good list, he will advance against to the
extent of about 75 per cent. of their market value,
thus leaving a margin of 25 per cent. in his favour
to cover the risk of depreciation, for they take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of themselves—these bankers. The majority of
advances in the provinces would be made against
securities and deeds in varying proportions, and it
is as well to remember that the larger the proportion
of tangible securities the smaller should be the rate.</p>

<p>A banker, it need not be said, does not want to be
bothered with a man, however good his securities, if
he think that there is the probability of his having to
call in the advance or to claim against his estate in
the Bankruptcy Court; and though a customer cannot
deposit marketable stocks and shares to the full
extent of his advance, but is compelled to offer deeds
and securities, as in our illustration, his credit is
often so good that many other bankers in his town
would readily listen to his proposals, and be only
too glad to get his name on their books, perhaps even
at a small sacrifice. Such a person can make a very
close bargain with his banker, and would not, for instance,
think of paying 5 per cent. when the Bank
rate is at 3 or under. He would, in fact, especially if
he were conducting a large business, probably be in
a position to make as good terms as the man whose
securities are wholly tangible.</p>

<p>The manager, of course, let the Bank rate be what
it may, will endeavour to obtain from 4½ to 5 per
cent. upon the overdraft of an account thus secured,
and to charge a rate of from ¹/₁₆ to ⅛ per cent. upon the
turn-over; but if the customer show fight, and losing
the account may not be thought desirable, because of
the local influence he possesses, then, rather than risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
his applying elsewhere, the agent usually lowers his
rates, for he naturally does not enjoy the thought
that esteemed clients are perhaps paying little calls
upon his rivals, and thereby advertising his own unpopularity.
When the rate of commission is the bone
of contention the customer’s first aim will be to pay
no commission whatsoever, and to at least arrange for
his advance at Bank rate with a minimum of 4 per
cent. Probably he may do better with reference to
his interest rate; and, if he finds that the manager
holds out for commission, then he can agree to a
nominal charge of from one to five guineas or so each
half-year according to the volume of his business.</p>

<p>We now have to discuss the position of those persons
who can only offer their banker the deeds of
house property, land, and those other securities for
which the market is a purely local, and, therefore, uncertain
one. A banker, whose deposits are mostly
payable at call and short notice, naturally prefers to
advance against those securities that are quoted on a
Stock Exchange, and does not care to lock up a large
proportion of his resources in house property, etc., of
which he cannot readily dispose in an emergency.
But tangible securities are not always to be had for
the asking; and, as he must employ his capital in
order to pay a dividend, he is compelled to advance
to a certain extent against, from his point of
view, the less desirable securities such as houses and
shares in some local company, though he always
prefers to deal with the man who can deposit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
more easily negotiable variety. Further, a prudent
banker will only devote a certain amount (and that
a relatively small amount) of his resources to advancing
against the deeds of houses, land, and so on; and
as the demand for overdrafts against this class of
cover is always greatly in excess of the supply, it follows
that those persons who borrow upon it have to
pay high rates.</p>

<p>We have seen that the client who possesses tangible
securities can, broadly speaking, make his own terms
but it is otherwise with the man who wants an overdraft
for business purposes against the deeds of a
house he owns; and he it is who is compelled to pay
5 or 5½ per cent. per annum interest, be the Bank rate
what it may, and ⅛ per cent. on the turn-over of his
current account; for he will not find the competing
banks anxious to secure his business by lowering their
rates. Should his credit be good, and his business be
considerable, he might succeed in reducing his commission
rate to ¹/₁₆ or even ¹/₃₂ per cent., and, of course,
he will make the attempt, but it would be unwise
to more than wish him success in his endeavour. A
really large tradesman, however, whose securities
consist of this variety, will sometimes find a bank-manager
anxious to secure his account, because he
thinks he may influence others in his favour, and such
a man will not pay high rates before he has at least
sounded two or three managers of well-known banks
and discovered that their terms are not more liberal.
He may even find that he can get his account worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
free of commission, or have the one he is paying
appreciably reduced.</p>

<p>Again, a man can mortgage his property, but, as a
rule, he prefers to obtain a “limit” on it from his
banker, more especially if he intend gradually paying
off the advance, as, should he borrow £500 on mortgage,
he will have to pay a rate on that sum, but
when he obtains a “limit” of £500, and his account is
only £250 on the wrong side, he pays on the smaller
amount only. As a rule, a solicitor acts as middleman
between a mortgager and mortgagee; and the borrower
might remember that solicitors, when advancing
their clients’ money, or, indeed, when they act in
any capacity, are quite as human as bank-managers,
and that it is always advisable to higgle with them
over the rate, which, of course, should be based on
the value of loanable capital at the time. The deed
usually stipulates for six months’ notice on either
side.</p>

<p>A customer who is desirous of obtaining an advance
upon property which already has a first mortgage
upon it, will not find the banks either sympathetic
or eager to assist him; though if his banker be
“in” with him he will, of course, accept any additional
security which is likely to lessen his risk or
minimize his loss. In the usual course of his business
second mortgages and equities of redemption are not
thought desirable, and then, again, the law does not
give a second mortgagee all the protection it might.</p>

<p>The current-account customer, who calls upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
bank-manager with the object of obtaining an overdraft
against property, will generally be asked if his
life is assured, and if he reply in the negative, he may
be requested to assure to the extent of the “limit”
the bank is ready to grant him, and to deposit the
policy as collateral security with the deeds. Many
men of small means assure their lives, and a banker,
provided the office be a good one, will generally advance
up to the surrender-value of the policy. This
he ascertains by applying to the assurance company,
which tells him at what figure they will commute it.
The rates charged upon this class of security are
high.</p>

<p>Where the customer’s overdraft is only partially
secured, he must make the best terms he can for himself;
and, as there is practically no competition for
such an account, he will probably have to pay from
5 to 6 per cent. per annum interest and from ⅛ to ¼
per cent. on his turn-over. These are the maximum
rates, which, no doubt, he will attempt to reduce,
though with what success must remain problematical.
The person who obtains an overdraft without security
must, as a rule, give thanks, and pay up with a light
heart, for should he apply elsewhere he would be
received with open-mouthed astonishment. A good
name in the banking world implies that its owner
is worth some few thousands of pounds; and
though, in the moral sense, its value is considered beyond
price, directors, while appreciating it in the
abstract, regret their inability to safely ensconce it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
within their safes, and therefore, as practical men,
their powerlessness to advance against it unless
backed by collateral securities.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words may be said anent personal
security. If you have a wealthy friend who is willing
to sign a promissory note with you, or to guarantee
your banker against loss up to a certain sum, an overdraft
can soon be arranged; but such a request puts
friendship to the severest test, and it may be extremely
difficult to find your friend at home should
he as much as suspect the reason of your visit.</p>

<p>We can see that competition is centred around the
safe business, and that though those persons who
possess tangible securities can make very close bargains,
the less desirable is the cover from a banker’s
point of view, other considerations being equal, the
higher are the rates the customer will probably be
asked to pay. The man who possesses the right class
of securities should, therefore, take them to the
cheapest market, and the owners of the less marketable
varieties might remember that from 4½ to 5 per
cent. per annum on the overdraft and ⅛ per cent.
commission on the turn-over are very full rates,
which may often be considerably reduced when the
customer, whose credit is good, does a large and profitable
business.</p>

<p>The only remaining subject for discussion is the
relation that exists between the bank-manager and
his directors, who confine his power to very narrow
limits. The city-manager, for instance, at the head-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>office
of a London joint-stock bank, might be empowered
to grant loans to the extent of from £2,000
to £3,000 without first obtaining the consent of the
board. Any application in excess of his “discretionary
power,” as it is called, would have to be
submitted to the directors, two or three of whom,
during certain hours, are always in attendance each
day, in order to deal with those requests for large
loans where an immediate decision is essential, while
a full board would probably sit twice a week. The
board, of course, would be asked to confirm the decisions
of the “daily” committee, and from time to
time the loans granted by the city-manager would
be subjected to criticism by that body.</p>

<p>At the metropolitan, suburban and country
branches the “discretionary power” of the agent or
manager would be based upon the amount of business
transacted at the branch. In a small town of from
20,000 to 30,000 inhabitants a manager might have
power to grant, when necessary, loans to the extent
of £350 and under, without first obtaining the sanction
of the board. All applications for advances in
excess of his power would have to be immediately submitted
to the head-office, accompanied by a letter,
describing the nature of the security offered, and
stating the desirability of obtaining or keeping, as
the case may be, the account. This report, in every
probability, would be addressed to the “advance
department,” where it would be criticized by the
officials before going into the board-room. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
questions would be asked with reference to the working
of the applicant’s account, his annual turn-over,
and so on. If he came to them from a rival bank
then they would want to see his pass-book, and, were
he already a customer, the manager would send a list
of his daily balances and comment upon his means,
habits, etc. Having satisfied themselves upon these
points, the chief of the advance department reports
to the general manager, who submits the application
to the board. The process, it will be seen, is cumbersome
and necessarily slow, for it often takes the
machine as many days to give a decision as it does a
private banker minutes.</p>

<p>The manager, evidently, has very little real power
under this system, and, practically, the branches are
managed from the head-office, the agent being a kind
of clerk-in-charge, who reports to, and announces the
decision of, his directors. Indeed, the rules and regulations
are framed for this very purpose, and the
banks make it part of their policy to effectually hold
their managers in check, and to so arrange the work
of an office that but little is left to their decision, while
it is the duty of the accountant to instantly report
any irregularity to the general managers. The average
bank-manager, it must be remembered, has had
neither a business nor a financial training, and it
would therefore be extremely risky to give him a
large field in which to make experiments. Of the two
evils the boards of the banking companies choose by
far the lesser, and, by allowing him a small “power,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
they tether him like a donkey to a stake, thereby
limiting his grass to the length of his rope.</p>

<p>In a large manufacturing city a manager’s discretionary
power would not exceed £1,000 to £1,500,
and in the smaller cities it would range from £500
to £1,000, while in the provincial towns it would be
from £300 to £500, according to population. Each
month the manager, as a rule, has to send to the head-office
a report upon all accounts that are <i>over</i> his
power, together with a separate one relating to bills
discounted, and at least twice a year he must submit
a long return of every overdrawn account on the
books of the branch certified by the accountant and
himself. The head-office, in short, watches him as a
cat does a mouse, and criticizes those advances he
himself is allowed to make severely should they not
meet with the approval of those in authority.</p>

<p>Then, again, as though determined that his steps
shall not stray from the beaten track, inspectors visit
his branch four or five times during the course of a
year, and, needless to say, the board thinks it neither
necessary nor desirable to advise him of the day one
will arrive. When the inspection is a short one the
unwelcome visitor counts the cash, checks the bills
and securities, just glances casually through the
ledgers and then takes his departure, when the atmosphere
seems lighter by his very absence, for exalted
officials are a weariness to the flesh. But during a
long inspection, which occurs about twice a year, the
manager has to make a short report upon every over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>drawn
account in the books. This done, he gives his
report to the inspector, who reads through his remarks
and proceeds to criticize them. Having added
a few words of his own, the visitor posts the bulky
report to the advance department at the head-office,
and, finally, it is laid upon the board-room table.
Then the fun begins. The manager, after a few
weeks of anxious suspense, receives a long list of
caustic inquiries relating to certain overdrawn
accounts which have failed to satisfy the board, together,
perhaps, with imperative instructions to get
such-and-such overdrafts reduced to certain figures
at a given date. Sorely tried in temper, the poor
agent sets about answering the questions put to him,
and then, much against his will, he writes to certain
clients whom he asks to give him a call.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps, the customers of the joint-stock
banks will understand why they receive so many
letters requesting them to keep their accounts at the
agreed limit, or even to reduce or pay off the overdraft
unless they can deposit either more desirable or
additional security. At such a moment an irritable
person is disposed to regret that “a company has
neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX <br/>
<small><small>HOW TO CHECK BANKERS’ CHARGES</small></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Bankers make up their pass-books in two ways.
When the customer is in account with the banker the
cash he pays in appears on the right-hand side of his
book, and the cheques he draws out on the left. The
more general method, however, is to make the bank
in account with the customer, when the debits and
credits in the pass-book are an exact copy of the
client’s own cash-book, whereas the entries in the
bank’s ledger are reversed. The latter and more
usual practice will be adopted in this chapter.</p>

<p>Customers often complain that they are unable to
check their half-yearly charges, that they do not
quite understand at what rates they have been
charged; and as some bankers are most careful to
add the interest and commission together, and then
to enter the aggregate in the pass-book as “charges”
simply, it is a little difficult to understand how they
expect their clients to check their interest and commission.
For instance, suppose a man is charged
£5 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and that the banker writes in his pass-book:</p>

<p class="center">
By charges, £5 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Here we have a puzzle that is more than Chinese in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
its intricacy and suggestiveness, for it is evident that
unless the customer remembers that he has arranged
to pay, say, 4 per cent. per annum interest and ⅛ per
cent. commission, he will experience considerable
difficulty in verifying the figures. As a matter of
fact, the companies are not particularly anxious to
enlighten him, for see how easily the client could have
checked his charges were they specified thus:—</p>

<table summary="" class="bordcoll">
<tr>
<td>By interest at 4 per cent.</td>
<td class="padh tdr">£4</td>
<td class="padh tdr">2</td>
<td class="padh tdr">0</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>By ⅛ per cent. commission on turn-over</td>
<td class="padh tdr">   0</td>
<td class="padh tdr"> 15</td>
<td class="padh tdr"> 6</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>By  postages</td>
<td class="padh tdr">0</td>
<td class="padh tdr">5</td>
<td class="padh tdr">0</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="padh tdr bt">£5</td>
<td class="padh tdr bt">2</td>
<td class="padh tdr bt">6</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Such a statement is almost beautiful in its simplicity,
and the entry “postages” may, perhaps, give us
some clue to the mystery, as it is evident that a manager,
by debiting charges in one sum, is thereby
enabled to hide certain debits such as “postages,”
“telegrams,” “legal expenses,” “stamps,” and so
on, at which, were they entered separately in the
bank-book, the customer would probably strongly
protest. And then, again, by adopting this method
of darkness, those persons who leave everything to
the agent never know their rates, and they are sometimes
too timid to call and inquire, as though fearing
that such a request would reflect upon the agent’s
honour.</p>

<p>Certain banks have an account open in their ledgers
called Law Charges or Sundry Charges, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
doubtful debits are posted in the names of various
customers. At the end of each half-year these sums
are credited to the account in question and included
in the clients’ charges. When, for instance, a manager
does not wish a person to know that he is paying
a fee of £3 3<i>s.</i> to the bank’s solicitors for the examination
by them of certain deeds which he has deposited
as security, he will probably resort to this subterfuge.</p>

<p>We can now criticize the account of John Jones,
who on the 31st December, 1902, owed his banker
£500 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and examine the entries in his pass-book
from that date to the 30th June, 1903, when his
bankers rule off their books and calculate their
charges. Assuming that Mr. Jones keeps proper
books, he will have an account in his ledger, which,
after making allowance for cheques drawn but not
presented for payment, will agree with his pass-book
in every particular. The following is a copy of his
bank-book:—</p>

<p>Mr. Jones’ ledger, then, assuming that none of his
cheques are outstanding, will show the same balance at
the debit of “bank,” though, of course, the dates will
not agree, as Mr. Jones credits the bank on the day
that he draws a cheque, whereas the bank debits him
on the day that it pays it. We can see that his banker
paid a cheque to Smith on the 15th February. If
John Jones drew the said cheque on the 12th, then he
debited Smith’s account and credited the bank on the
same day. But these entries, as we shall see in our
next illustration, appear upon the opposite sides of
the banker’s ledger.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, whose securities are tangible, has
arranged with the manager that he is to pay 4 per
cent. per annum on the overdraft and ⅛ per cent.
on his turn-over, and to receive 1½ per cent. on
his daily credit balances. Having received his pass-book,
he wishes to check his charges, and after
making two or three attempts, he is convinced of the
futility of his efforts, so renounces his task in despair.
He has worked the figures out in his own way, which,
though a little primitive, he generally finds answers
pretty well, and, as his figures come to something
like those entered in the pass-book, he supposes
that it is all right. Perhaps the following copy
of his account as it stands in the bank’s ledger may
therefore prove both illuminating and instructive:—</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">*</span></a>
Three days’ interest upon “cheques” paid to credit. 756 × 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Now everything should be as clear as the flowing
brook to Mr. Jones. He should, in the first instance
rule a sheet of paper in exactly the same manner as
the specimen page of the banker’s ledger. He next
carries the entries from his pass-book to the ruled
sheet, taking care that each amount, whether debit
or credit, is placed under its right date, and at the
end of each day, or when the next date appears, he
extends the balance, as in our illustration, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
upon this balance that the bank either allows or
charges him interest for one, two, or twenty days, as
the case may be, at an agreed rate. He then multiplies
this balance by the number of days, and carries
the product into a “total” column, which he adds
up at the end of the half-year. This done, the rest is
a very simple business for anybody who can manage
a rule-of-three sum.</p>

<p>The banker, we can see, brings forward the amount
of Mr. Jones’ indebtedness on the 31st December
when his books were ruled off. This opening entry,
which amounts to £500 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, is placed in the debit
column of his ledger, and extended as a debit balance.
Upon the morning of the 1st January, therefore, one
day’s interest was owing on £500, but the next operation
upon the account did not take place until 20th
January; and as from 31st December (excluding the
31st and counting 1st January as one day) to 20th
January (inclusive) there are twenty days, the customer
owes twenty days’ interest upon £500. If we
multiply 500 by 20, as in our form, and carry the
product into “total” column, he then owes one
day’s interest upon £10,000. The result, of course, is
precisely the same; so a banker, in order to save a
multiplicity of calculation, adopts this rule throughout,
with the result that, at the end of the half-year,
his client owes one day’s interest upon £37,422.</p>

<p>Bankers, when referring to the figures in the “total”
columns, speak of them mysteriously as “decimals,”
and the customer, upon hearing so ominous a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
word, jumps to the conclusion that bankers’ calculations
are most difficult and involved, when, in reality,
they are of the simplest nature imaginable. Evidently
the product in question is the result of a
simple multiplication sum; so why bankers should
speak of extending the “decimals,” when there is
none to be extended, must ever remain one of the
enigmas of their trade.</p>

<p>As a rule, should the shillings in the balance
column be ten or over, the banker, in making his calculations,
calls them one pound, and when less than
ten shillings he ignores them. On the 20th January,
for instance, the shillings are excluded, but upon the
26th May £47 is the sum we have to multiply by five.
Further, in arriving at the number of days between
two dates, exclude the first date and include the
second, or vice versa, but do not include both dates.</p>

<p>The second “total” column of our form is for
creditor results, or, as bankers incorrectly call them,
creditor decimals, the left-hand column being, of
course, the debtor, and the right the creditor, just as
though they were left-and right-hand pages of a
cash-book. Having ascertained the number of days
from date to date, we add them up, and next proceed
to balance them. From 31st December, 1902, exclusive,
to 30th June following, inclusive, there are 181
days, and, as those are the figures in our days’
column, we know that they are correct. Next we add
up the “total” columns, and here great care is necessary,
because it is impossible to balance the figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Dealing with the debit total first, we find that
John Jones owes his banker one day’s interest at 4
per cent. per annum upon £37,422. Hence:—</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdc bb">37,422 × 4 × 1</td>
<td rowspan="2">= £4 2<i>s.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">100 × 365</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But Mr. Jones will make these figures £35,154, and
the answer £3 17<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, and upon asking for an
explanation he will be told that he has been charged
three days’ interest upon the cheques he paid to his
credit during the half-year. The banker argues that
his client receives credit for the cheques he pays in
immediately, whereas he himself has to collect them
through the “clearing,” and does not receive the
money for two or three days. The argument is somewhat
fallacious as to the length of time, but we need
not discuss that minutely. Mr. Jones points out that
he pays in cash and local cheques as well as cheques
upon London and country bankers, and that, therefore,
he cannot understand why the manager charges
him three days’ interest upon the total sum paid to
his credit during the half-year. He will, of course,
decline to submit to this charge, and request the
manager to refund him 4<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> (three days’ interest
upon £756 at 4 per cent. per annum).</p>

<p>With reference to the rate, the average Bank rate
from 31st December to 30th June works out at
£3 17<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> While his account was overdrawn, however,
the official minimum was at 4 the whole time,
so the rate is a fair one, but this question has already
been discussed in the previous chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>His banker owes him 1½ per cent. per annum upon
his creditor balances, which are multiplied by the
days and extended in our second “total” column.
He has, therefore, to receive 1½ per cent. per annum
upon £3,891 for one day. Hence:—</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdc bb">3,891 × 1½ × 1</td>
<td rowspan="2">= 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">100 × 365</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As this is the sum debited in the pass-book, Mr.
Jones’ mind is at rest <i>à propos</i> of the correctness of
the figures; but it will probably occur to him that
the rate might be improved, for the fact that one is
borrowing at 4 and lending at 1½ is not conducive to
harmonious thinking.</p>

<p>Next, he checks the commission on his turn-over,
which he makes £117. He pays ⅛ per cent., of
course, upon the amount of the cheques credited in
his pass-book during the half-year, and these come
to the sum aforesaid. Hence:—</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdc bb">117 × 1</td>
<td rowspan="2">= 2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">100 × 8</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But his banker has charged him ⅛ per cent. on
£617. His glance falls upon the balance forward of
£500 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and it at once occurs to him that the
manager has charged him thereupon, that, in short,
a mere banker’s opening entry has been included
in his turn-over. Excited by this discovery, Mr.
Jones calls upon his banker, and points out to him,
with a touch of Celtic intensity, that he sees no earthly
reason why he should pay 12<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> simply because the
bank has made an entry of its own in his pass-book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Moreover, with a keen eye for mathematics, he
clearly demonstrates that he has already paid commission
upon the various transactions which resulted
in the said balance; so the manager, adjusting his
spectacles, and praying Mr. Jones to moderate his
language, allows that, in the hurry of business, a little
mistake has occurred. A customer, when checking
his charges, should see that he does not pay commission
upon opening entries of this description, as,
needless to say, they are merely there in order to
enable the banker to balance his books, and bear no
relation whatever to a client’s turn-over, though
they are sometimes added to it.</p>

<p>Just referring to the rate of commission, ⅛ per cent.
we know, seems too much, so Mr. Jones may be recommended
to read Chapter VIII of this book.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the entry “Postages, 5<i>s.</i>”
The manager, during the half-year, writes numerous
letters to his customers, sends their pass-books to
them through the post, and so on; therefore, in order
to reduce his incidental expenses, he debits a few
shillings to certain easy-going clients before the books
are ruled off, and so as to prevent awkward questions
being asked, he includes these small sums with
“charges.” Mr. Jones, who has probably not
received half a dozen letters from the bank during
the half-year, will naturally refuse to pay this
imposition.</p>

<p>Should a customer not have made arrangements
with the manager as to the rates he is to pay, he
would ask at what rates his account has been charged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and then proceed to check the banker’s figures in the
manner indicated in these pages. Such an entry as
“charges” has nothing better than its extreme
vagueness to recommend it, and the client, when he
finds this word in his pass-book, should, if he experience
any difficulty in checking the figures, return it to
the manager with the request that he will give him
full particulars as to the rates of interest and commission,
and also tell him the amount of any additional
charge or charges, if there be any.</p>

<p>We can now make out a table of the amount Mr.
Jones has to reclaim from his banker:—</p>

<p>The commission on £617 is 15<i>s.</i> 5¹/₁₀<i>d.</i>, but a banker
would charge 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Mr. Jones, we can see, has
been overcharged to the extent of £1 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and we
may rest quite assured that he will not be easy in his
mind until he has recovered this sum from his banker.</p>

<p>Sometimes a customer, when ruling off his own
books, draws a cheque for, say, £600, and pays it to
his credit at the bank. This would be a cross entry.
But does he understand that this sum will be included
in his turn-over, and that if he be charged ⅛ per cent.
thereupon, he pays 15<i>s.</i> to his banker for making a
couple of entries in his ledger? Again, if the manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
charge him three days’ interest at 5 per cent. per
annum upon the sums paid to his credit, he will pay
another 5<i>s.</i> (about), and at this rate a cross entry of
£600 would cost him 20<i>s.</i> The luxury, it must occur
to him, is expensive; and as this illustration is not a
figment of my imagination it is evident that everybody
who keeps a banking account should understand
how to check a banker’s charges.</p>

<p>It seems an act of supererogation to point out that
the average account would contain very many more
entries than the one under review, but if the reader
will carefully follow these instructions he should
find little difficulty in checking the charges in any
bank-book. Where the account has been overdrawn
during the entire quarter or half-year the first “total”
column must be used. Our example is that of a
mixed account, and both columns are required; but
should the account be a creditor one, then the extensions
are made in the second “total” column, and
the banker, of course, will allow the customer a rate.</p>

<p>When checking the interest of a loan account it
is advisable to obtain a separate pass-book from
the banker, and not to take out the entries from
the current-account pass-book wherein the interest is
debited. Should it be found that the commission has
been charged upon the amount of the loan, the customer
would ask for an explanation, and in checking
his interest he would proceed in exactly the same
way as shown in our example.</p>

<p>Again, we have seen that some customers arrange
that their rate shall be either Bank rate or ½ above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it, as the case may be. Suppose that the Bank rate
on the 22nd April were raised from 3 to 3½ per
cent., and that it had stood at 3 from 31st December.
The customer, who has agreed to pay his banker ½
above Bank rate, will then owe 3½ per cent. per
annum on the sum or sums he has borrowed from 31st
December to 22nd April. Applying this hypothesis
to the account under review, we rule a line beneath
the figures 6,160 in “total” column, and add up the
column, which comes to 30,600. From 31st December
(exclusive) to 22nd April (inclusive) there are 112
days (see page 59), and, as the figures in the days’
column give the same result, we know that they are
correct. The customer, then, owes his banker one
day’s interest at 3½ per cent. per annum upon
£30,600. At each change of the Bank rate this process
must be repeated; so instead of having one rule-of-three
sum to work out, as in our illustration, there
may perhaps be four or five of them.</p>

<p>Should the fortunate possessor of a large creditor
account have arranged with his banker that he is to
receive 1½ per cent. <i>below</i> Bank rate on his daily credit
balances, then assuming that the balances on our
form were creditor, the banker would owe 1½ per cent.
per annum on £30,600 for one day. The customer,
when calculating the amount due to him, would proceed
in the same manner as indicated above, and he
might remember that, in arriving at the number of
days from one change of the Bank rate to another, he
excludes the day from which he calculates and includes
the date to which he calculates. The rest is easy.</p>

<h3>Discounted Bills.</h3>

<p>The city-article of every morning paper contains a
list of market discounts from which one can see at
what rates the bill-brokers and discount-houses are
taking the various classes of bills. Bank-bills would
be paper either accepted or indorsed by the banks;
and fine trade-bills or best trade-bills would be the
acceptances of those firms whose credit is so good
that the question of their paper not being paid at
maturity is practically never considered. As the
credit of the banks ranks highest it follows that
bank-bills can be discounted at the finest rates.
Again, less risk is run on a three months’ bill than
upon one for four or six months. In other words, the
position of an acceptor is less liable to change in
three months than in six, therefore short bills are in
greater favour; consequently, the rate upon a six
months’ bill, other considerations being equal, will
be higher than that upon one which has three months
to run, though the difference, of course, will only be a
fractional one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The bill-brokers, we know, obtain most of the
bank and the fine bills, but they are also dependent
upon Lombard Street for the greater part of their
resources; and as a bank, which owes huge sums on
demand, likes to keep its assets as liquid as possible,
it follows that bankers take short bills from the
brokers in preference to those which are drawn for
long terms, for the simple reason that should they
think the outlook uncertain and deem it prudent
to strengthen their reserves, the shorter bills will run
off the more quickly, thereby providing them with
additional cash. A three months’ bill, therefore, from
a banker’s standpoint, is considered more desirable
than one at six months’ date.</p>

<p>When trade is active and loanable capital dear
market rates of discount will naturally be high, and
the Bank rate, speaking broadly, is generally in touch
with the market rate for three months’ bank-bills.
Conversely, when trade is dull and the prices of commodities
are falling, fewer bills will be on offer; but
the fund with which they are discounted will be proportionately
greater, consequently the market rates
of discount will be low, as, also, will be the Bank rate.
It must be remembered, however, that the Bank of
England discounts bills for its own customers below
its published rate—when its minimum is temporarily
above the market rate; for were it not to adopt this
course its customers would naturally discount their
bills with the brokers.</p>

<p>As the bill-brokers are middlemen between Lom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>bard
Street and those merchants who have bills to sell
it follows that the market rate of discount is always
below the bankers’ rates, and that, therefore, holders
of the better-class paper take it to the brokers, but
this peculiarity has been mentioned in Chapter VI.
It may, however, be added that the remittance of the
best country bills to the London bill-brokers is a comparatively
new movement, which the banks do not
regard with favour. Competition between the brokers
being keen, it is questionable whether the finest rates
are quoted in the papers, for the merchants who have
bills for sale will, of course, not neglect to higgle with
the brokers, who, like the bankers themselves, certainly
would not advertise their lowest rates.</p>

<p>The large discount-houses and brokers possess considerable
capital, though it would look extremely
small when contrasted with the short-loan fund, and
they deposit certain approved securities with the
banks against the money at call advanced to them;
but the small bill-brokers are little better than runners
for the banks with whom they re-discount their
bills almost as soon as they are in their cases, and
their capital would consist principally of a silk-hat
and a bill-case. Certain brokers on the Stock
Exchange, it may be added, stand in much the same
relation to Lombard Street. Besides borrowing
from the banks the bill-brokers also accept deposits
from the public, basing their rate upon the Bank rate,
and allowing a slightly higher rate than the London
bankers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The market for bills is a special market, into which
the banks pour their surplus funds, so customers will
be careful not to confuse the price of a bill with the
price of a loan, though, of course, there is a close
connexion between the two; for when loanable
capital is dear discount rates too are high, and when
the former is cheap the latter are low. The London
customer, who discounts fine bills with his banker,
will naturally take care that he does not pay a higher
rate than the bill-brokers would charge him, and
when he discounts second-rate trade-bills he will
remember that competition is very keen, and that if
his credit be good he can generally induce the manager
to quote a fine rate.</p>

<p>Coming to provincial banking, we have seen that
the large merchants and manufacturers remit some
of their best trade-bills to London; but in the great
cities, where the banks are numerous, the competition
for good paper is considerable; and as the customer
usually keeps his current account at the bank
with which he discounts his bills, he can generally, if
his account be worth retaining and his credit good,
get his paper discounted at Bank rate, or even
slightly under when the market rate is below it.</p>

<p>In the small country towns, however, the banks’
rates are higher, but then, of course, the paper they
discount there is not of the same class; and a capitalist,
be he a money-lender or a banker, raises his rate
in proportion to the risk he runs, the one thinking a
bill so doubtful that 100 per cent. will just tempt him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to risk his principal, and the other drawing the line at
about 7 per cent.</p>

<p>A, for instance, has an acceptance of C’s for £100,
dated the 1st January and drawn for one month, so
the bill, allowing the usual three days’ grace, will be
due upon the 4th February. A takes this bill on the
5th January, to his banker, by whom it is discounted.
From the 5th January exclusive, to the 4th February,
inclusive, there are thirty days; and assuming that
the discount rate be 5 per cent. per annum, and the
rate of commission upon the amount of the bill ⅛ per
cent., we get the following:—</p>

</table>

<p>A, therefore, has paid about 6½ per cent. per annum
for the accommodation. The country banks, when
they charge 5 per cent. per annum interest and ¼
per cent. commission upon short bills, obtain something
like 8 per cent. per annum upon their capital;
but, needless to say, the persons who pay these
rates are either out of touch with the market or else
their credit is so bad that they are glad to discount
their bills with a banker upon almost any terms.
And then, again, there is not much paper of this description
under discount with the provincial banks.</p>

<p>Country customers, whose credit is above suspicion,
make very close bargains when they take good trade-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>bills
to the banks to be discounted, and seldom pay
any commission upon the amount of the bill, though,
of course, the manager will attempt to exact it if he
think that his man will pay without protest. As
previously stated the customer almost invariably discounts
his bills with the banker with whom he keeps
his current account, and he generally pays the same
rate on his paper as he does upon his overdraft.
Competition for desirable accounts being keen, it
follows that a client who discounts largely can always
bring pressure to bear upon the manager, should he
consider that his rates are excessive and altogether
out of touch with the market rates.</p>


<h3>Coupons.</h3>

<p>Many people leave their coupons with bankers
for collection, and here, again, we get an example of
making those pay who will. The usual rates are ⅛
per cent. commission on English and ¼ per cent. upon
foreign and colonial coupons, but, as a matter of fact,
certain managers keep a list of those persons who
refuse to pay these charges, while they who do not
protest, no matter how large a sum they may keep to
their credit upon current account, are made to pay
the ordinary rates. It is only fair that a person whose
average credit balance does not exceed £50 should
pay a rate; but when a man keeps from £250 to £500
and above on the right side, the banker can quite well
afford to forego his charge.</p>

<p>Suppose a banker receives £40 from his London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
agent or through the coupon department of his head-office
on account of coupons remitted for a customer.
He deducts his charge of 2<i>s.</i>, and, without informing
the person for whom they have been collected,
credits £39 18<i>s.</i> in his pass-book. The client, in five
cases out of six, remains under the impression that he
has received the market value for his coupons, whereas,
had the manager credited the account with £40,
and debited it with 2<i>s.</i> commission, the customer in
every probability would have asked for an explanation.</p>

<p>The customer, by examining his pass-book, will
soon discover whether a rate has been deducted, and
if he consider that the balance he keeps at his credit
amply repays the bank, then he can request that the
commission be returned to him, and that his name be
placed on the free list with those of other “conscientious
objectors.” Where the face-value of the
coupons is given in a foreign currency, he will, of
course, have to discover the rate of exchange at which
they were sold. Allowance, too, must be made for
income-tax.</p>

<p>When purchasing stocks or shares through his
banker the latter divides the commission with the
broker, and it is perhaps advisable to see the broker’s
note, as a zealous manager, anxious to augment the
profits of his branch, and believing devoutly in the
old-fashioned maxim “every little helps,” occasionally
adds a small charge of his own. Should he do
this, then he sends the customer a <i>copy</i> of the broker’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
note instead of the note itself, and in the copy he has,
it need not be said, added a small commission of his
own to the broker’s. As a banker guarantees the
customer against loss through the failure of either the
broker or the jobber, purchasing shares through a
bank has its advantages for the bona-fide investor;
but the speculator, who may want to “carry over”
from account to account, must deal with a member of
the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Again, when buying foreign drafts through one’s
banker inquiry should be made as to the rate of
exchange, so that one can check his figures. In a
small book of this description much must necessarily
be omitted, but it may just be added that in these
days the facilities bankers grant their customers
range from taking charge of their plate and valuables
to allowing them to have their letters addressed to the
bank, while they will even pay their subscriptions for
them. The difficulty is to say what they will not do,
and some day, perhaps, we shall have their young
men calling in the morning for orders with the baker.</p>

<small><small>UNCLAIMED BALANCES</small></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I would describe this banking custom as legal stealing.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">*</a>
Bankers, as well as other estimable persons,
obtain their gleanings and their perquisites, which are
credited to certain sundry accounts, such as “unclaimed
dividends,” “unclaimed balances,” and so
on. Those banks, too, that issue notes must profit
to a certain extent by the paper that is lost and
destroyed by the public; and though it is impossible
to estimate the gain to the banks from these sources,
their absolute silence on the subject seems to indicate
perhaps more eloquently than statistics, that the
fund thus derived must be considerable, even if it be
not vast.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">*</span></a> The Government is not prepared to promote legislation
for the purpose of requiring the banks of the United
Kingdom to make a return showing the sums of money in
their hands in respect of dormant and obsolete accounts.—Vide
Press, Feb. 1908.</p></div>

<p>Coming to the definition of an unclaimed balance,
it must be confessed that it is somewhat difficult to
explain exactly what an “unclaimed” balance is, for
the simple reason that the banks, when an account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
becomes dormant, seldom make an effort to discover
whether the owner be either dead or alive, or to
whom the balance belongs. On the other hand, if
they do not court inquiry, it cannot be said that they
obstruct it. Neither, however, do they encourage it,
nor assist the owner or claimant in any way, but content
themselves with passively carrying forward the
figures from half-year to half-year. The public may
well be dissatisfied with this treatment, for it is quite
apparent that were the banks to make it their business
to discover the owners or claimants they would
be successful in five cases out of six, and, further, the
longer they nurse these so-called “unclaimed”
balances, the greater is the probability that they will
for ever retain them.</p>

<p>We will first discuss the position of the current-account
customer in relation to this practice. As a
rule, it is well known to the members of a deceased
man or woman’s family where the banking account
was kept; so inquiries are usually made, and the
balance standing to the credit of the deceased ascertained.
There are, however, exceptional cases. A
man may have accounts with two different bankers
and though one is known, the second may not be. If
the pass-book relating to the second account be at the
bank, the manager very probably will keep it there.
Again, a person on a visit to a place may open a small
temporary account at a bank there, and should he
die suddenly the manager will not make any attempt
to trace his representatives. When the pass-books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which relate to these “unclaimed” balances are at
the bank, some managers are most careful that they
shall not go out again; and, in order to prevent their
being sent through the post to the addresses on the
ledgers, the books are generally placed in some out-of-the-way
corner of the strong-room, there to await
the coming of their owners. This is certainly a novel
way of protecting the interests of one’s clients,
though it doubtless has not the smallest claim to
originality, and may not be completely unknown in
other trades than that of banking.</p>

<p>Secondly, we come to the deposit-receipt or deposit-note;
and it will readily be allowed that a small
piece of paper of this description may easily be either
lost or accidentally destroyed. It must be borne in
mind, too, that the companies, in the event of a
depositor’s death, do not take any steps to inform
either his next-of-kin or his legal representatives
that certain sums of money are standing to his credit
in their deposit-ledgers, even when they are aware of
his decease. Then, again, after a depositor’s death
these documents are sometimes overlooked or inadvertently
cast aside with other papers. Such
sums, after a lapse of years, might go to swell a
company’s unclaimed balances.</p>

<p>But it is a misnomer to speak of these sums as
“unclaimed,” when it is obvious that they are simply
“unpublished,” and that the banks, were they so inclined,
could find the true owners of a large number
of these balances in a very short space of time. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
many instances they have good reason to think that
the customers are dead, even when they possess no
positive information to that effect; and as they have
their addresses in the deposit-ledgers, all they have to
do is to write a few letters of inquiry. However, the
banks have the law on their side; and though they
are obliged to answer any questions which may be
made by a deceased’s representatives, they are not
compelled to give information gratuitously, so they
choose to remain silent, and insist upon the initiative
being taken by interested persons.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a deceased depositor may have held
three deposit-receipts. Should two of these be presented
for payment by his executors, the manager
need not inform them that there is a third sum standing
to the credit of the deceased in the books of the
bank; and he possibly will not. An interested person,
therefore, should always inquire whether there be
any other sums standing to the credit of the deceased,
either on current account or deposit.</p>

<p>It need not be remarked that should the balance be
a debit one the bank will speedily send in its claim,
together with a note of sympathy to the widow,
begging her to consider the company quite at her
service. So hardened is a bank-manager that he will
actually attend the funeral of an old and esteemed
client whom he has been charging 5½ per cent. interest
and ¼ per cent. commission for years. It is a
bad sign when a limited liability company is represented
at a funeral by an official; and should two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bank-agents put in an appearance, one can only
quote: “Where the carcass is, there will the vultures
be gathered together.” Seeing that they are so eager
to exhibit their respect for the rich dead, it may be
considered somewhat surprising that they are not
more sympathetic towards the poor living, and, also,
that they do not publish their so-called unclaimed
balances for the benefit of their customers’ descendants;
but life is full of these little contradictions,
and, after all, the acids and the sweets, judiciously
blended, give a zest to existence.</p>

<p>Finally, some banks, we know, issue pass-books to
their depositors instead of receipts. It sometimes
happens that, at a depositor’s death, the book is with
the banker. Unless, therefore, his own people chance
to know that he had a deposit account, all traces of its
existence are obliterated, for the banker, who has the
book in his possession, is not compelled to give any
notice. After the publication of one of my books my
publisher received a letter from a lady complaining
bitterly that a certain bank had treated a kinswoman
of hers in this manner. Should the relations of a
deceased man or woman have reason to suspect that
money has been saved and placed somewhere, they
should go to every bank in the town where the deceased
resided and inquire whether any sums are
standing to his credit in the books of the banks.
Their application cannot be refused, and the result
may possibly be somewhat surprising, while they will
at least have the satisfaction of knowing that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
kinsman’s savings are not being devoted by the banks
to their own use.</p>

<p>As the law now stands, a deceased customer’s balance
is, to a certain extent, at the mercy of his
banker; but whether these unclaimed balances would
in the aggregate amount to the huge total at which
some people are disposed to estimate them is rather
doubtful. That the law urgently requires amending
cannot, however, for a moment be questioned, for
persons whose own interests conflict with those of the
public can seldom be trusted to judge impartially;
and it is quite evident that directors, who are imbued
with the commercial instinct, are not exceptions to
the rule. The aggregate, no doubt, would be represented
by a large sum, but the public, where money
is concerned, generally looks pretty smartly after it,
so one would imagine that this total would consist
principally of numerous small balances, and that
large windfalls must be few and far between.</p>

<p>These so-called “unclaimed” balances are, we
have seen, in reality <i>unpublished</i> balances, and steps
certainly ought to be taken to compel the joint-stock
banks to advertise in certain London and local papers
the names and last known addresses of those individuals
in whose names sums of moneys, in excess of
say £5, have been standing intact in their books for
any period in excess of five years. The banks might
also be made to hang a list of these names in a conspicuous
part of their offices, so that those who are
entitled to these sums should at least have an oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>tunity
of claiming them. Were the companies compelled
to adopt this course, we should hear very little
more of unclaimed balances, for the thought of publicity
would be distasteful to them, and they would
immediately take steps to put themselves in communication
with either the customers or their kinsfolk.
One would think, too, that the Government had
a better claim to these balances than the banks. Mr.
Asquith, for instance, might find them useful as
a basis for his old-age pension scheme!</p>

<p>Depositors, seeing how matters stand, should keep
their receipts in some place where they cannot be
overlooked; and in the event of a pass-book being
received, a note should be made in a diary, or even in
the “Family Bible,” to the effect that such a book is
in existence; as, should it be at the bank at the
time of a customer’s decease, we know that the
manager may retain it, with the result that all trace
of the money will be lost.</p>

<small><small>BANK SHARES</small></small></h2>
</div>

<p>There is not space in this chapter to deal exhaustively
with the risks of shareholders, but it may be
mentioned that, with the exception of the old chartered
banks, the members or partners of every joint-stock
bank in the United Kingdom were, prior to
1858, liable jointly and severally for the debts of the
company. This Act, Statute 1858, c. 91, was not,
however, compulsory; and although no bank of unlimited
liability has since been formed, it was not
until the passing in 1879, after the failure of the City
of Glasgow Bank, of the Act 42 &amp; 43 Victoria, c.
76, that all the unlimited banks eventually limited
the liabilities of their members. Naturally, a person
of considerable wealth would hesitate to risk his
fortune by buying shares in an unlimited bank which
perhaps returned him only 5 per cent. on his purchase-money;
but this objection is not now applicable,
though it must not be forgotten that the shareholder
is liable for a certain known sum, part of
which may be callable and the remainder reserved
liability, or all of which may be reserved liability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and callable only in the event of the company
being wound up. Where notes are issued the
members may also be liable for the circulation.</p>

<p>Now that the liability on bank shares is a certain
sum that cannot be exceeded the investor is inclined
to regard them favourably; and though a rich man,
who can afford to take a certain amount of risk, may
decide to hold a few bank shares among his other
securities on account of their higher yield, this
liability, be the risk of a bank coming to grief never so
small, makes them a most undesirable investment for
those persons the interest upon whose capital is just
sufficient to supply their wants. Bank shares, in short,
are rich men’s shares; but this fact was brought
home to the public so forcibly during the Australian
banking crisis of 1893 that it seems unnecessary to
dwell upon a point which must be apparent to everybody.
Besides, we all know that a man of small means
cannot afford to incur a liability on bank shares any
more than he can sign an accommodation bill, and it
would be as foolish of him to accept the one responsibility
as the other. Nor is he the class of shareholder
to whom the depositor can look with confidence.</p>

<p>While allowing that the great majority of our
banks are prudently managed, it must be granted
that banking history is a remarkably stormy one,
though it is equally true that the surface of the waters
has been but little ruffled during recent years; still,
the Baring crisis of 1890 is not yet ancient history;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and seeing that the banks are intimately connected
with the Stock Exchange, the bill-brokers and the
commercial community, a person who predicts that a
British bank will never again be in difficulties must
be blessed by the Almighty with a most sanguine
temperament, for such a prediction is altogether
opposed to the weight of evidence adduced by the
past, and though its fulfilment is eminently desirable,
so peaceful a solution of the banking question seems
highly improbable.</p>

<p>In Chapter II, on the choice of a banker, an
attempt was made to show why a customer should
select a strong institution whose working resources
are plentiful, and whose reserve of liquid assets is
large enough to enable it to meet a drain of deposits
during a run or a panic. The shareholder who guarantees
the customers of a bank against loss to a limited
extent will naturally take care that he is a partner in
a company which maintains an adequate reserve of
cash and securities as an insurance fund against those
accidents which are quite beyond the control of the
most able board of directors. A shareholder, say,
holds twenty-five shares in a bank. These shares are
for £80 each, and the amount paid up upon each is
£20. He, then, receives a dividend upon £500, and
incurs a liability of £1,500. But he bought these £20
paid shares at such a price that they only yield him 4½
per cent., and he certainly cannot afford to run any
great risk for such a return; so he therefore, before
purchasing, took care that the bank held a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
accumulation of cash and gilt-edged securities as a
reserve fund against those banking risks for which
he pledged £1,500 of his fortune. Every prudent
man should take the same precaution.</p>

<p>The following illustrations, which are taken from
the balance-sheets of two English joint-stock companies
that need not be named, will clearly demonstrate
that there are banks—and banks.</p>


<h3>An English Provincial Bank.</h3>

<p>Liabilities to the public upon current, deposit and
other accounts are given in the balance-sheet as
£4,200,000. The bank’s liquid assets are thus described:—</p>

<p>This bank’s position might be described in one very
short word. In the first place, it has neglected to
state the amount of its cash in hand and with bankers
at call separately, but has mixed it up with its loans
at short notice. The only deduction to be made is
that the bank possesses so little legal tender that it
deems it prudent not to give the figures in its balance-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>sheet,
but to inform the public that it holds £13·8 of
cash in hand, at call and at short notice to each
£100 of its public indebtedness. The second entry
is equally vague. We are quaintly informed that
this unique institution, which owes some millions on
demand, is in possession of a certain amount of Consols,
but the exact sum, and the price at which they
are taken, have been left to our imagination, so the
bank may be the proud possessor of either £100 or
£1,000 of Consols; and goodness only knows what is
meant by “other securities.” The second column of
our form, however, shows us that this company held
£4·1 of “Consols and other securities” to each £100
it owed to its customers. Then, with a touch of true
comedy, the auditors tell us that the balance-sheet,
in their opinion, exhibits a true and correct view of
the state of the bank’s affairs. One’s very soul goes
out to those auditors, and a longing seizes hold of one
to pat them on the back and shout bravo! No doubt
the statement is true and correct, but how strangely
incomplete.</p>

<p>Of course there is a serious side to this question.
The bank, we can see from the total in our ratio
column, held only £17·9 of cash and certain securities
in reserve against each £100 it owed to the public.
Obviously it is trading on the reputation of its
better-prepared rivals, who, should a determined run
be made upon it, might feel disposed to save it;
but during a crisis, when each company has to take
care of itself, such a bank, were its depositors to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>come
nervous, would be compelled to close its doors in
a very few hours. Now, would any sane person buy
the shares of this bank at a price which returns him
about 4½ per cent. on his capital, and incur a liability
in excess of the amount of his holding? One would
say emphatically not; but it is a remarkable fact
that people are to be found who will take this risk
with a light heart. Surely they cannot understand
the nature of the security they are buying.</p>

<p>A bank which is caught short of cash during a
crisis must apply for assistance to the Bank of England,
and the Bank, which at so critical a time is the
only market for securities in existence, would, before
making it an advance, demand to see its securities.
This bank, we know, possesses a list of “Consols and
other securities” which it values at £172,170; but if
the Bank advanced £100,000 against them, which is
highly improbable, how could it pay off even £500,000
of its deposits? It seems to me that it must go
under. The usual fate of these weak provincial
banks is amalgamation with the better managed and
more powerful companies, but the danger is that a
storm may sweep them out of existence before they
drift into one or another of these havens of rest.
Fortunately, the state of the bank in question is
exceptional rather than representative, but it is
unwise to jump to the conclusion that the shares of
every English bank are a desirable investment.</p>

<p>Ambiguity is not the dominant note in this balance-sheet.
We can see at a glance that the bank is well
prepared to pay off a large proportion of its indebtedness
on demand, for it holds £15 in cash against every
£100 it owes. Money at call and notice (short loans
to the bill-brokers and stockbrokers), which is much
less liquid than cash, is stated separately, and its list
of investments consists entirely of British Government
securities. Moreover, we are told at what price
they have been taken. The balance-sheet, though
not perfect, is clear and informing; but a company
that holds £4,000,000 of Consols at 90 would not be
so foolish as to hide its financial light under a
bushel; so when a bank modestly refers to “Consols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and other securities” we may be quite sure that its
holding of Consols is either remarkably small or else
that its directors are exceedingly stupid. It is more
probable, however, that they are astute gentlemen
who reason that the luminosity of a farthing dip
might call forth smiles of wonder and amazement were
it allowed to shed its radiance and waste its fragrance
outside the bushel.</p>

<p>The bank we are discussing, then, held £56·2 of
cash, call money and gilt-edged securities in reserve
against each £100 of its liabilities to the public; and
such a bank, it need not be said, is splendidly prepared
to protect the balances of its depositors and
the interests of its members. As a matter of fact,
the real interests of both are identical; for if a bank
neglects to keep an adequate reserve of cash and
securities it exposes its customers to the risk of loss
and inconvenience through its stoppage during a run
or a panic; as, should the bank suspend payment,
the customers must either suspend too, or find another
banker, while its shareholders might lose all
their capital and also be called upon to make good
any deficit. Obviously, then, the bank which holds
£56 in liquid assets to each £100 it owes is the one
with which to do business. The shares of this bank
return about 4½ per cent. at the present market
price; and seeing that the company has minimized
the risks of its members its shares will be chosen in
preference to those of the institution which has accumulated
a somewhat doubtful reserve of liquid assets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which works out at a ratio per cent. to its liabilities of
only £17·9.</p>

<p>We next come to a banking company’s profits,
which are a source of great annoyance and wonderment
to certain people, who cannot understand how
dividends of from 10 to 20 per cent. can be earned in
the worst of times when everybody else is feeling the
depression in trade acutely. The mystery is not very
profound, for a banker’s business, of course, is only
profitable so long as he can trade with the money of
his depositors, and, as his own capital is usually small
when compared with his deposits, it follows that a
very small percentage on his working resources will
return a high rate of interest upon his capital. Upon
a certain amount of his deposits he allows a rate which
is regulated by the Bank rate; and he charges a rate
upon his loans and advances, the said rate being also
more or less influenced by the Bank rate, the difference
between the two rates representing his margin of
gross profit. He regulates this margin by changing
his deposit rate at each alteration of the Bank rate,
but he also obtains money upon which he does not pay
interest, and as that sum earns considerably more
when the Bank rate is at 4 than when it is at 2½, it
follows that his “free” money is largely responsible
for the fluctuations of his dividends.</p>

<p>But a banker cannot trade with all his deposits.
He has to keep a certain sum lying idle in his safes
and tills, and with his London agents or the Bank of
England. He further requires a good list of securities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which can be either converted or pledged with the
Bank of England should occasion arise, and such a
list will not return him much more than 3 per cent.
upon the sum devoted to that purpose. Then he
employs a portion of his funds in the short-loan
market, so he has only about 60 or 70 per cent. of
his deposits to advance in the shape of loans, overdrafts
and discounts to customers. In other words, a
well-managed bank has to devote a large proportion
of its resources to insuring its business.</p>

<p>Take the bank in our second illustration. Its paid-up
capital amounts to £2,800,000, and its reserve
fund to £1,600,000, so the shareholders’ funds come
to £4,400,000. Deposits and other accounts are
£26,652,300, making its total working resources
£31,052,300. Now the net profit earned during the
half-year was £207,869, so the bank cleared ·669 of a
pound upon each £100 with which it was trading;
and seeing that the trader expects to make 10 per
cent. on his turn-over, it is pretty evident that
bankers’ profits shrink into insignificance when
compared with his. But the bank’s paid-up capital
is only £2,800,000; and as £14,000 will pay 1 per
cent. per annum for the half-year on that, this profit
of £207,869 enables the bank to declare a dividend
at the rate of 14 per cent. per annum, and to carry a
large amount forward to the profit-and-loss account
of the next half-year; yet it can hardly be said that
its earnings on £31,000,000 are enormous; still, they
look it when metamorphosed into a rate of 14 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cent. But this is only another illustration of how
easily the crowd can be deceived by statistics.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to attempt in a short chapter to
discuss the price of bank shares; but as the banking
companies, unless they enjoy an exceptionally sheltered
position, earn less during those periods of
depression which from time to time overtake the
trade of the country, it follows that their dividends,
like their deposit rates, rise and fall with the Bank of
England rate. Bank shares, therefore, can be bought
cheaply when trade is bad and loanable capital
cheap. As the so-called gilt-edged securities, during
normal times, should then be dear, it often pays to
sell out of the latter, invest in bank shares, and wait
for the turning of the tide.</p>

<small><small>THE PAY OF BANK-CLERKS</small></small></h2>
</div>


<p>It cannot be said that bank-directors, when considering
the question of remuneration, err on the side of
generosity; but nobody would dream of accusing
them of that crime, and if the bank-clerk is not paid
lavishly, his salary, as a rule, is appreciably above the
wages paid for clerical labour in the open market.
Nor can it be affirmed that the country private
banker was one whit more generous than a board
of directors. Indeed, the evidence points in quite an
opposite direction, for the clerks of those firms which
have been absorbed by the companies generally profited
by the change; so it must be allowed that the
joint-stock system has raised the standard of comfort
of the bank-clerk. Certain of the London private
bankers were more liberal, and others, again, had the
commercial instinct strongly developed, but we shall
see the salary scales of the joint-stock banks are not
calculated to excite envy in the mind of the multitude,
unless we except the unemployed and the
hungry.</p>

<p>At the head-office in London, where there is a special
scale, the city-manager would receive from £1,000 to
£1,500 a year, and the chiefs of departments from
£300 to £1,000, according to the importance of the
department, while the salaries of the ledger-clerks
would be raised £10 each year until the maximum,
£300, had been reached. The maximum for clerks
is £180. At the metropolitan and suburban branches
however, the salaries are the same as those set out in
the foregoing list, and the managers would receive
from £300 to £800 or so a year in proportion to the
business done at the branch. Very few of the joint-stock
banks would pay a higher scale of wages than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
this, and the great majority of them, especially the
purely provincial companies, would pay considerably
less, while the Scotch banks are niggardly
in the extreme—a little national characteristic.
It is on record that a clerk in a certain Scottish
banking company, whose head-office is at Aberdeen,
was receiving £30 a year at the end of five
years’ service. In a fit of unaccountable generosity
his salary was then raised to £50 per annum, but the
recipient remarks that he showed his gratitude by
promptly moving to London.</p>

<p>Adverting to our list, we can see that a youngster
entering this bank at the age of, say, seventeen, gets
£30 a year, out of which he has to pay certain subscriptions.
At the age of twenty his salary would be
increased to £80, and £10 at the end of each year’s
service would be added until the maximum for clerks,
£160, were reached. He would then be twenty-eight,
and there he would have to wait for the bank to make
him either a cashier or an accountant before he could
proceed to the next step. A few men remain clerks
all their lives, but the percentage would be a very
small one, and in every probability the clerk might
count upon being promoted at the age of thirty-three
or thirty-four. With good luck, or should he chance
to have a friend at “court,” he might gain this step
at thirty.</p>

<p>Assuming that he were made a cashier at thirty-one,
he would start with a salary of £170, and, rising £10
a year, would reach the maximum of this class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
£210, when he was thirty-five years of age. The percentage
of men who remain in this class all their lives
is appreciable, and the average man probably would
not get a small branch before he was forty-five or
forty-eight. Of course, if he successfully accomplished
some such feat as marrying the plain daughter
of a general manager, or should he be distantly
related to a director or a Lord Mayor, he might get a
branch at forty. But the prizes are for the very few,
and those men who do really well, after having managed
a small branch to the satisfaction of the board,
are sent to a larger office upon a salary of £400 a year
rising to about £600. At this rate a clerk would be
from forty-eight to fifty-two or three before his salary
was £400 a year, and it must be remembered that
these are the fortunate ones; so it is evident that the
majority of clerks in a bank simply eke out an
existence.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they are better paid than the
average merchant and solicitor’s clerk, while their
employment is constant, and, as a rule, they are
entitled to a pension, should they survive the
monotony of their surroundings, after having
attained the age of sixty. Seeing that these young
men are drawn from the same class as the merchant’s
clerk, and that the demand for their berths is greatly
in excess of the supply, it appears at first sight that
£160 a year is a fair wage for a person whose principal
accomplishments are a bold round hand and the ability
to add up long columns of figures with accuracy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
despatch. However, it seems improbable that a
father, after having carefully considered the chances,
will choose a banking career for a son who can pass
examinations successfully.</p>

<p>Then, again, the average youngster has more
chances in business; for while a few hundred pounds
will establish him as a trader, as many thousands will
not enable him to become a banker. The banks, so to
speak, take their men right off the market, and give
them a special training, which fits them for banking
alone, but which, as a rule, totally unfits them for
any other business; consequently, when a bank-clerk
suddenly find himself flung back on the market,
he at first usually feels as helpless as a bird which
suddenly turned out of the cage in which it was
bred, is compelled to sustain life after the manner
of its kind. As the bank-clerk generally enters a
bank for life, he has a right to expect that the
shareholders and directors will at least recognize
this fact, and, therefore, pay him a salary based,
not only upon the market price of clerical labour,
but also upon the assumption that he will pass his
days in the service of a company in which he will
always be a servant. In other words, as the directors
practically hire these men for life, it is their
duty to make their circumstances fairly easy, but
this is an obligation which the majority of them
quite fail to recognize.</p>

<p>The smaller banks have a much lower scale than
that given in these pages; and certain of those com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>panies
which are pushing out small suburban tentacles
in every direction pay the managers of these
offices from £80 to £120 a year, and the clerks in
proportion. Moreover, some boards have passed
resolutions to the effect that no clerk in their service
shall marry until his salary be such-and-such a
sum; and it seems intolerable that a body of men,
who are merely traders, be the resolution good or
bad, should be allowed to interfere with the liberty
of the subject in this arbitrary fashion. Mr. Punch’s
advice is doubtless excellent; but who are these
men, in their astounding consequence, to override
the law of the land? The whole nation should
indignantly protest against their impudence, for a
mere trading company, whose only object is gain,
is unfit to govern the sons of men. Possibly, if
these banks were to publish their salary scales
their sham philanthropy would be instantly apparent.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few illustrations of the relations between
the banks and their clerks may prove interesting.
I have in my mind the case of a man who
sat by my side at a large branch bank in the North.
From being a chief-clerk or accountant in the service,
he had been reduced to £160 a year, and sent to
the branch in question. The cost of living being
expensive in a large city, he was compelled to send
his children to the Board schools. In fact, he was
so hard up that he wrote to the general managers
telling them that he could not live on the salary,
and asking them to increase it. He was told that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
if he were not satisfied, he could take a year’s salary
(I think it was) and go. The bank, however,
ultimately succeeded in getting rid of him more
cheaply. The man, who was a tailor’s tout and an
insurance agent in his spare moments, did all in his
power to add to his income; but at last he fell so
low that he actually descended to taking money
from the men’s coats. Then followed detection
and dismissal.</p>

<p>Now, who was the more to blame, the clerk or the
bank? The clerk had informed the directors that he
could not live upon his salary, and the directors
made him an impossible offer, for the man, who
must have been getting on for fifty, had been
in the service from a boy, and was therefore not
worth thirty shillings a week outside. Knowing
this, the offer of the directors was frankly brutal,
and losing hope the clerk became a petty thief.
My ethics may be somewhat shaky, but were I on
my trial for a harp and a halo I would rather stand
in the thief’s place than in that of those directors.</p>

<p>Another man in the same office, although single,
could not acquire the art of living upon £160 a year,
and after some few years of unsuccessful striving
and vain endeavour, he was dismissed for drink
and debt. He then became a traveller in the wine
trade, and terminated his not uninteresting career
by getting drunk on his samples. A third man,
who was a married cashier, took two sovereigns
from his till, intending to return them upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
following day, but his till-money was counted the
very next morning by the accountant, who was
probably suspicious, and the man had to go. Out
of a staff of twenty-eight men, five, I think, were
cashiered within five years; it seems to me that
were a kinder spirit manifested by those in authority
much of this misery and suffering might be spared.</p>

<p>For instance, in one service it is usual to send
old men and others who, for some reason or another,
have been reduced, to a large branch, where, after
a few months have elapsed, they are given a small
sum of money and quietly pushed into the street.
This procedure is adopted because a man at a small
branch is acquainted with the accounts of all the
customers thereat, and might, should he be dismissed
while there, hold forth in every public-house
in the town; but the expedient is unspeakably
mean, and surely a bank which counts its deposits
by millions can afford to temper justice with mercy.
The directors know the fate that awaits these men,
more especially when they are past forty, and it is
simply cruel to weed them out in this brutal fashion.
To my mind it is little short of murder.</p>

<p>The system, of course, is bad. The banks place
one man in authority and to that man they pay a
good salary. He, in his turn, has to hold down the
rest, with the result that we have already seen. At
the branch in question the manager, who was an
old man, received £1,500 a year, and the accountant,
who was a man of about forty-two, got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
£300. The disparity between these two sums
is most marked, for the accountant was quite
as able a man as his chief, and if he were only
worth £300 a year, then the manager was not
worth more than £500 at the outside. Were a
bank to pay each man a fair salary, and to reduce
the manager’s rate of pay, it would increase its
expenses considerably, but at the same time it
would add to the efficiency of its staff, for most
of the men are dissatisfied, and the work, as a rule,
is not done willingly, while the directors are looked
upon as task-masters. Nor is this at all surprising,
for of sympathy they display but little, and their
humanity is unquestionably not superior to that of
the Zulu. I have weighed my words carefully,
and am writing without the slightest heat, my only
aim being to state my facts plainly, and I think
that, if the facts are unchallenged, the deductions
are as indisputable as they are discreditable to the
directors and shareholders of certain of the joint-stock
banks.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
